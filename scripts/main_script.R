# Project Title: Marine benthic habitat sensitivity 


# AIM: Develop sensitivity maps for the benthic substrate to a range of activities taking place in the marine environment
# Further: The pressures refer to the 36 OSPAR + 3 pressures, from a suite of activities in a single MarESA operation, e.g. Fishing.

# Script name: Main script
## This is the main script which runs the support functions, sequentially, making objects available to coming/sequential functions. I.e. The user should only have to run this script to produce outputs.

#-------------------------------------------------
# START
# Clear workspace if not cleared! i.e. there should be nothing in the R Global Environment at this point: you will need all the RAM available to you to process the script
rm(list = ls()) # this will remove all objects inthe R environment. Run this to ensure a clean start.

# TIP: If you are editing the code, I have left commented out pieces of code, like the below, in which may be useful in future. Remove the comment and run if you know what you are doing.
# rm(list=setdiff(ls(), c("hab_map"))) # useful command to remove all but the habitat map which takes long to read - useful during testing

#-----
# R libraries
## Below the list of R libraries to load into R (in sequence). If they are not already installed on your machine you will have to do so first. This can be done using the command like install.packages("RODBC"), for each of the libraries. Then load them by running the commands below.
library(RODBC) # allows connecting to databases
library(DBI) # allows connecting to databases
library(tidyverse) # data wrangling scripts
library(plyr) # more data wrangling scripts
library(reshape2) # more data wrangling scripts
library(rgdal) # gis scripts
library(magrittr) # piping scripts, loaded again and here to ensure that some funtions run as they are written
library(stringr) # text manipulation library
library(sf) # key GI library
library(doParallel)

# Parallel processing set-up ----------------------------------------------
cl <- makeCluster(4) # set Power PC  = 8 or more, laptops about 3 (depending the number of processors available. Note that more processoirs speeds up the calculations, but the more processors you apply, the greater the amount of RAM needed.
registerDoParallel(4) # same as above
