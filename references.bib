  abstract = {Bottom trawling causes widespread physical disturbance of sediments in seas and oceans and affects benthic communities by removing target and non-target species and altering habitats. One aspiration of the ecosystem approach to management is to conserve function as well as biodiversity, but trawling impacts on benthic community function need to be understood before they can be managed. Here we present the large scale and long term impact of chronic trawling on the functional composition of benthic invertebrate communities using a comprehensive set of functional traits. The effects of chronic trawling disturbance on the functional composition of faunal benthic invertebrate communities, as sampled with a small beam trawl, were investigated at 6 to 13 sites in each of 4 contrasting regions of the North Sea. Each site was subject to known levels of trawling disturbance. Information on the life history and ecological function traits of the taxa sampled was translated into fuzzy coding and used to analyse the relationship between life history and functional roles within the ecosystem. Multivariate analyses were used to examine changes in the distribution of traits over gradients of trawling intensity. Changes in the functional structure of the community due to the effects of long-term trawling were identified in 3 of the 4 areas sampled. Filter-feeding, attached and larger animals were relatively more abundant in lightly trawled areas, while areas with higher levels of trawling were characterised by a higher relative biomass of mobile animals and infaunal and scavenging invertebrates. Univariate analysis of selected traits confirmed the patterns observed in multivariate analysis. These results demonstrate that chronic bottom trawling can lead to large scale shifts in the functional composition of benthic communities, with likely effects on the functioning of coastal ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Bottom trawling causes chronic and widespread disturbance to the seabed in shallow shelf seas and could lead to changes in the trophic structure and function of benthic communities, with important implications for the processing of primary
production and the wider functioning of the marine ecosystem. We studied the effects of bottom trawling on the trophic structure of infaunal and epifaunal benthic communities in 2 regions (Silver Pit and Hills) of the central North Sea. Within each
region, we quantified long-term (over 5 yr) differences in trawling disturbance at a series of sites (using sightings data from fishery protection flights), and related this to differences in the biomass and trophic structure of the benthic community.
There were 27- and 10-fold differences in levels of beam trawl disturbance among the Silver Pit and Hills sites respectively, and we estimated that the frequency with which the entire area of the sites was trawled ranged from 0.2 to 6.5 times
yr-1 in the Silver Pit and 0.2 to 2.3 times yr-1 in the Hills. The impacts of fishing were most pronounced in the Silver Pit region, where the range of trawling disturbance was greater. Infaunal and epifaunal biomass decreased
significantly with trawling disturbance. Within the infauna, there were highly significant decreases in the biomass of bivalves and spatangoids (burrowing sea-urchins) but no significant change in polychaetes. Relationships between trophic level
(estimated using nitrogen stable isotope composition, $\delta$15N) and body mass (as log2 size classes) were rarely significant, implying that the larger individuals in this community did not consistently prey on
the smaller ones. For epifauna, the relationships were significant, but the slopes or intercepts of the fitted linear regressions were not significantly related to trawling disturbance. Moreover, mean $\delta$15N of the
sampled infaunal and epifaunal communities were remarkably consistent across sites and not significantly related to trawling disturbance. Our results suggest that chronic trawling disturbance led to dramatic reductions in the biomass of infauna and
epifauna, but these reductions were not reflected in changes to the mean trophic level of the community, or the relationships between the trophic levels of different sizes of epifauna. The trophic structure of intensively trawled benthic invertebrate
communities may be a robust feature of this marine ecosystem, thus ensuring the efficient processing of production within those animals that have sufficiently high intrinsic rates of population increase to withstand the levels of mortality imposed by
trawling.},

  abstract = {Bottom trawling causes widespread disturbance of sediments in shelf seas and can have a negative impact on benthic fauna. We conducted a large-scale assessment of bottom trawl fishing of benthic fauna in different habitats, using a theoretical, size-based model that included habitat features. Species richness was estimated based on a generalized body mass versus species richness relationship. The model was validated by sampling 33 stations subject to a range of trawling intensities in four shallow, soft sediment areas in the North Sea. Both the model and the field data demonstrated that trawling reduced biomass, production, and species richness. The impacts of trawling were greatest in areas with low levels of natural disturbance, while the impact of trawling was small in areas with high rates of natural disturbance. For the North Sea, the model showed that the bottom trawl fleet reduced benthic biomass and production by 56\% and 21\%, respectively, compared with an unfished situation.

Although ecological effects of MPAs are well documented, their impacts on fishing communities and the spatial distribution of fishing effort remains elusive and poorly understood. In 1999, a MPA network was implemented to protect against perceived declines of reef fish harvested for the aquarium trade on the island of Hawaii. We investigated how the MPA network altered the spatial distribution of fishing effort and impacted perceived fisher socioeconomic well-being and fishing operations, as well as if the economic and catch benefits offset costs in the newly established non-MPA fishing areas. Data were collected using social surveys, experimental fishing, and catch reports. The results suggest the MPA network significantly displaced fishing effort from the central to the northern and southern coastal regions of the island farther from ports of entry. Estimated catch revenues and experimental catch per unit effort were statistically greater as distance from port of entry increased. Perceived fisher socioeconomic well-being was unaffected, but perceived fishing cost and travel time increased significantly post-MPA network implementation. Although the MPA network displaced fishing effort, fisher socioeconomic well-being was not compromised likely because they expanded their operating range and favorable market factors helped offset potential economic losses. Our findings are relevant because they help clarify how MPA networks alter spatial fishing behavior and impact the well-being of small-scale fishers.},

Mean damage levels, and the proportions of the 4 damage scores in the bycatch and on the seabed, were the same in most species. Some common species did show differences. The edible crab Cancer pagurus was more severely damaged when not
captured, while the starfish Asterias rubens and whelk Neptunea antiqua received greater damage within the bycatch. Capture efficiency for the megafauna was low, ranging from 2 to 25\% among species. The results indicate that the majority of
damage to large benthic invertebrates during scallop dredging occurs unobserved on the seabed, rather than in the bycatch.},

Physical and biological changes were measured on large (600 \texttimes{} 600 m) experimental plots that were dredged with an intensity and duration similar to normal fishing operations. Dredges were most efficient on soft, flat, muddy sediments (51-56\% of commercial-sized scallops caught) and least efficient on firm, sandy sediments with more topographic variation (38-44\%). Dredging flattened all plots, but changes to topography were most apparent on plots dominated initially by callianassid mounds. Dredges caught predominantly the scallop Pecten fumatus, and damage to bycatch species was slight, except for high mortality rates ({$>$}50\%) of spider crabs and the probable mortality of many discarded ascidians. Changes to benthic community structure caused by scallop dredging were small compared with differences between study areas, and even marked reductio..., Les impacts des dragues \`a p\'etoncles et leur efficacit\'e ont \'et\'e \'etudi\'es exp\'erimentalement dans trois secteurs pr\'esentant des substrats mous diff\'erents dans la baie de Port Phillip, dans le sud-est de l'Australie. On a mesur\'e les changements physiques et biologiques dans de grandes parcelles exp\'erimentales (600 \texttimes{} 600 m) qui ont \'et\'e dragu\'ees avec une intensit\'e et pour une dur\'ee semblables \`a celles des op\'erations normales de p\^eche. Les dragues \'etaient plus efficaces sur les s\'ediments mous, plats et vaseux (51 \`a 56\% des p\'etoncles de taille commerciale captur\'es) et moins efficaces sur les s\'ediments fermes sableux pr\'esentant plus de variations topographiques (38-44\%). Le dragage a aplati toutes les parcelles, mais les changements topographiques \'etaient plus apparents dans les parcelles domin\'ees initialement par les monticules des callianassid\'es. Les dragues ont surtout captur\'e le p\'etoncle Pecten fumatus, et les dommages aux esp\`eces des prises accessoires \'etaient peu importants, sauf dans le cas des araign\'ees de ...},

  abstract = {Field experiments were conducted on 2 subtidal sandflats to identify the short-term impacts of commercial scallop dredging on macrobenthic communities. The 2 sites (1400 m\textsuperscript{2}) were situated 14 km apart, both at about 24 m depth, with similar
exposure aspects and were characterised by infaunal communities dominated by small and short-lived species. Prior to dredging, preliminary sampling failed to reveal significant differences in the density of common macrofauna within each site, although
community composition was distinctly different between sites. The experiment was initiated by using a commercial scallop dredge to dredge half of each study site. Macrofauna samples were collected in both the dredged and adjacent reference plot at each
site immediately after dredging and again 3 mo later. The density of common macrofaunal populations at each site decreased as a result of dredging, with some populations still significantly different from the adjacent reference plot after 3 mo.
Significant compositional differences in the assemblage structure between dredged and reference plots were also recorded at each site over the course of the experiment. The findings of this experiment are considered a conservative assessment of bottom
disturbance by fishing because of the area of seabed used, the types of community present and the intensity of disturbance used in the experiment. The findings of this and similar short-term experiments are discussed in light of the need to predict and
assess possible large-scale changes to benthic communities as a result of habitat disturbance by fishing.},

  abstract = {We describe and analyse data on fishing effort collected by interviewing 1914 fishermen between 2007 and 2010. Combining socio-spatial data collected through a voluntary mapping project called ``FisherMap'' with UK and European vessel satellite monitoring data provides high resolution, national-scale maps of distribution and relative intensity of fishing for six gear types. The effort maps show, for the first time, a large scale and holistic approach to mapping fishing effort by including the under-reported, yet significant, inshore fishing fleet (85\% of registered vessels,{$<$}15m). The data from this study have been used to facilitate the planning, management advice and subsequent designation of 38 inshore Marine Conservation Zones. The authors conclude that, effective management of the inshore marine environment requires up-to-date, high resolution and holistic maps of fishing effort that can be obtained only through validated interpretation of inshore vessel monitoring system data.},
