#genereate a list of biotopes matched to the mapped habitat (based on EUNIS codes) within sub-biogeoregions from the results files. The function sequentially assesses the EUNIS levels from 6 to 4. Where an empty value at a higher EUNIS level is found it will look in the next lower level, until it runs out at level four, when it leaves the value at NA.
