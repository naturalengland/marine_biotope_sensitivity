<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>The United Kingdom’s (UK) marine environment is of significant economic value, in which the exploitative activities and infrastructure development is constantly weighed up against their impact on the environment <span class="citation">(Walport and Boyd 2017)</span>. The UK’s marine environment is subject to a vast array of pressures, such as fishing operations, marine aggregate dredging, development of renewable energy and risks of pollution from oil spills among many others. Overfishing and habitat loss are regarded as two of the main contributors to the degradation of the UK’s marine environment <span class="citation">(Walport and Boyd 2017)</span>.</p>
<p>Commercial fishing operations are widespread throughout the United Kingdom, and is fished by both national and international fleets within the remits of the London Fisheries Convention (1964) and the Common Fishery Policy (CFP 1970s). Many of the existing regiulations and laws are therefore enshrined in EU maritime law. The withdrawal of the UK from the European Union (EU exit), which is scheduled for the 29 March 2019,<a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/16/section/20">European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, section 20</a>; <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:12016M/TXT&amp;from=EN">Article 50</a>, is likely to lead to change in fisheries regulations and management <span class="citation">(Phillipson and Symes 2018)</span>. Leaving the EU may change how fish stocks are shared across political borders, quota allocation to EU-member states in the UK, and Total Allowable Catch (TAC) for different stocks among many other aspects related to managing the UK fishing grounds <span class="citation">(Phillipson and Symes 2018)</span>. A change in fishing regulations and management may have substantial ramifications fishing operations in the UK. The spatial distribution of fishing effort among various fishing metiers is a key element is likely to be influenced by a change in regulations <span class="citation">(Vaughan 2017)</span>. Previous research has shown that a displacement of fishing effort could lead to detrimental environmental and socio-economic effects <span class="citation">(e.g. <span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="stevensonSocioeconomicConsequencesFishing2013a"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>. It is therefore important that the impact on the marine environment brought about by a displacement of fishing effort be considered prior to adopting new regulations or change in management practices <span class="citation">(Vaughan 2017; Chollett, Box, and Mumby 2016)</span>.</p>
<p>Delineating the geographical distribution of habitat sensitivity has been identified as critical dataset for managing human activities on the marine environment <a href="http://0-www.publish.csiro.au.wam.seals.ac.za/mf/MF00003">Bax, N.J. &amp; Williams, A. ( 2001) Seabed habitat on the south‐eastern Australian continental shelf: context, vulnerability and monitoring. Marine and Freshwater Research, 52, 491– 512.</a>. The sensitivity of marine habitats have previously been defined as sensitivity as <em>“the degree to which marine features respond to stresses, which are deviations of environmental conditions beyond the expected range”</em> <a href="https://0-onlinelibrary.wiley.com.wam.seals.ac.za/doi/full/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2005.00148.x">Sensitivity and Vulnerability in Marine Environments: an Approach to Identifying Vulnerable Marine Areas</a>. Previous attempts to use quantitative methods to delineate benthic habitat sensitivity were limited by the level of detail about the underlying benthic habitat upon which fishing activities impact. These studies have assumed that benthic habitat were comprised of four broad-scale categories, such as mud, muddy sand, sand and gravel. Current quantitiative models therefore do not consider differences in living structures occuring within these habitats. These models are therefore likely to over- or under-estimate the sensitivity of fine-scale habitats within these very broad defintitions of habitat. Previous alternative efforts to map out geographical distribution of habitat sensitivity have been critisised for being score based or expert judged systems e.g. Tyler Walters 1999, Zacharias and Greg 2005, which are therefore not repeatable or quantitative <a href="https://0-besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com.wam.seals.ac.za/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2007.01274.x">Assessing and predicting the relative ecological impacts of disturbance on habitats with different sensitivities</a>; <a href="https://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/10.1139/f02-148#.XIpjkSj7RPY">A size-based model of the impacts of bottom trawling on benthic community structure</a>. Despite this limitation, both quantitative and scored based systems of habitat sensitivity have been based upon the same central tenet of resilience and recovery.</p>
<p>Natural England provides statuary conservation Advice on Operations in English territorial waters (from the shore to 12 NM offshore) to the Defra, regulators and developers. Natural England also provides advice out to 200 NM offshore for renewable energy through the delegation of responsibility from the Joint nature Conservation Council (JNCC). Natural England uses sensitivity assessments of protected bethic habitats and species to inform its Advice on Operations. The sensitivity assessments include 39 pressures associated with a 100 activities stemming from 18 operations in the marine environment. Natural England’s statuatory remit is restricted to protected habitats and species within English marine protected areas (MPAs), known as designated features. The designated habitat features are represented at a intermediate scale of detail, known as EUNIS (European Nature Information System) level 3. The conservation advice is therefore limited to a subset of the area of English territorial waters, and provided at a coarser scale of habitat detail than is available for the UK seabed. In recognition that impacts from a displacement of fishing effort occurring outside of MPAs can have an impact on features within MPAs, a “wider-seas” and “whole-sites” approach was used to assess the sensitivity of benthic habitats to fishing activities for the UK’s EEZ (Exclusive Economic Zone). The whole-sites and wider-seas approach means that currently protected features were not considered in isolation, but that the connectivity between benthic habitats were considered to provide a holistic overview the spatial distributions of fishing related impacts on the benthic habitat. Natural England holds a bespoke dataset which details potential fine-scale habtiats (EUNIS level 4 - 6) which occur within the broader habitat categories (EUNIS level 1 - 3) within the subbiogeographical sea regions around England from 0 to 12 NM offshore. The bespoke dataset was informed through expert consultation with Dr Keith Hiscock (Hiscock, K. 2016).</p>
<p>The objective of this project was to map the spatial distribution of sensitive benthic habitats in relation to 39 pressures caused by fishing activities in the UK’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). The study area includes the wider seas (outside of MPAs) to provide evidence of sensitive habitats which may be affected by a displacement of fishing pressures arising from different scenarios of EU Exit.</p>
<p>Previous studies have developed tools to predict the impacts of fishing effort displacement, which forecast a change in fishing effort displacement <span class="citation">(Bastardie, Nielsen, and Miethe 2013)</span>. This project did not attempt to predict a change in fishing activity given the significant uncertainty and complexity in how Brexit would affect fishing opportunities and regulations in the UK. In this study habitat sensitivity to standardised pressures from various fishing activity were mapped as a precautionary approach given the manifold uncertainties associated with fishing displacement arising from Brexit, such as how trade negotiations may influence fishing rights allocations. Previous work which have mapped benthic habitat sensitivity have used a different approach . Broad-scale benthic habitat and</p>
<p>A case study was developed to explore the potential use of benthic habitat sensitivity models to help inform NE of potential impacts ion the marine environment.</p>
<p>In this report a case study was developed to inspect the potential application of the habitat sensitivity mapping in relation to spatial maps of fishing activity. Fishing activities have had profound effects on the UK’s marine ecosystem, of which bottom towed fishing gears is one of the most damaging activities which altered benthic habitats, composition and trophic structure of fish and invertebrate communities over the last century of industrial fishing <span class="citation">(M. J. Kaiser et al. 1998; S. Jennings et al. 2001; J. G. Hiddink et al. 2006; H. M. Tillin et al. 2006; Thurstan, Brockington, and Roberts 2010)</span>. The spatial overlap of benthic habitat sensitivity maps and the distribution of fishing related dredging activities were compared to evaluate the use of sensitivity mapping as a tool to inform management of options to minimise the impacts of a the spatial distribution of fishing activities. The habitat sensitivity maps were therefore evaluated as an data set to inform conservation advice in the event of displacement of fishing effort. The ability of the tool to identify recently non-fished sensitive benthic habitats were explored, as a means to inform spatial planning in the UK’s EEZ.</p>

<p>The equitable redistribution of marine resources, such as fishing quota allocation, remains a key challenge to resource managers, for example. <span class="citation">(Halpern, Gaines, and Warner 2004)</span>. The remit of NE’s statutory powers : National National Reserves (NNRs) in England, including terrestrial and marine environment. In the marine environment, NNRs include special Protected Areas (SPAs), Special Areas of Conservation (SACs), Marine Conservation Zones (MCZs), collectively referred to as Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) hereafter. All MPAs in the England are currently multi-use areas, within which protected features exist. Remove: It is therefore critical for marine resource managers to understand the distribution of fishing impacts in relation to the distribution the habitats and species to minimise damage to UK marine ecosystems. It is therefore imperative that marine environment and fisheries bodies make the necessary provisions to minimise potential damage arising from a change in fishing regulation following Brexit.</p>
