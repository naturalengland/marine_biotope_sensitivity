The UK’s marine environment is subject to a vast array of pressures, such as fishing operations, marine aggregate dredging, development of renewable energy and risks of pollution from oil spills among many others. Overfishing and habitat loss are regarded as two of the main contributors to the degradation of the UK’s marine environment (Walport and Boyd 2017). Commercial fishing operations are widespread throughout the United Kingdom, and is fished by both national and international fleets within the remits of the London Fisheries Convention (1964) and the Common Fishery Policy (CFP 1970s). Many of the existing regiulations and laws are therefore enshrined in EU maritime law. The withdrawal of the UK from the European Union (EU exit), which is scheduled for the 29 March 2019,European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, section 20; Article 50, is likely to lead to change in fisheries regulations and management (Phillipson and Symes 2018). Leaving the EU may change how fish stocks are shared across political borders, quota allocation to EU-member states in the UK, and Total Allowable Catch (TAC) for different stocks among many other aspects related to managing the UK fishing grounds (Phillipson and Symes 2018). A change in fishing regulations and management may have substantial ramifications fishing operations in the UK. The spatial distribution of fishing effort among various fishing metiers is a key element is likely to be influenced by a change in regulations (Vaughan 2017). Previous research has shown that a displacement of fishing effort could lead to detrimental environmental and socio-economic effects (e.g. ???). It is therefore important that the impact on the marine environment brought about by a displacement of fishing effort be considered prior to adopting new regulations or change in management practices (Vaughan 2017; Chollett, Box, and Mumby 2016). Delineating the geographical distribution of habitat sensitivity has been identified as critical dataset for managing human activities on the marine environment Bax, N.J. &amp; Williams, A. ( 2001) Seabed habitat on the south‐eastern Australian continental shelf: context, vulnerability and monitoring. Marine and Freshwater Research, 52, 491– 512.. The sensitivity of marine habitats have previously been defined as sensitivity as “the degree to which marine features respond to stresses, which are deviations of environmental conditions beyond the expected range” Sensitivity and Vulnerability in Marine Environments: an Approach to Identifying Vulnerable Marine Areas. Previous attempts to use quantitative methods to delineate benthic habitat sensitivity were limited by the level of detail about the underlying benthic habitat upon which fishing activities impact. These studies have assumed that benthic habitat were comprised of four broad-scale categories, such as mud, muddy sand, sand and gravel. Current quantitiative models therefore do not consider differences in living structures occuring within these habitats. These models are therefore likely to over- or under-estimate the sensitivity of fine-scale habitats within these very broad defintitions of habitat. Previous alternative efforts to map out geographical distribution of habitat sensitivity have been critisised for being score based or expert judged systems e.g. Tyler Walters 1999, Zacharias and Greg 2005, which are therefore not repeatable or quantitative Assessing and predicting the relative ecological impacts of disturbance on habitats with different sensitivities; A size-based model of the impacts of bottom trawling on benthic community structure. Despite this limitation, both quantitative and scored based systems of habitat sensitivity have been based upon the same central tenet of resilience and recovery. Natural England provides statuary conservation Advice on Operations in English territorial waters (from the shore to 12 NM offshore) to the Defra, regulators and developers. Natural England also provides advice out to 200 NM offshore for renewable energy through the delegation of responsibility from the Joint nature Conservation Council (JNCC). Natural England uses sensitivity assessments of protected bethic habitats and species to inform its Advice on Operations. The sensitivity assessments include 39 pressures associated with a 100 activities stemming from 18 operations in the marine environment. Natural England’s statuatory remit is restricted to protected habitats and species within English marine protected areas (MPAs), known as designated features. The designated habitat features are represented at a intermediate scale of detail, known as EUNIS (European Nature Information System) level 3. The conservation advice is therefore limited to a subset of the area of English territorial waters, and provided at a coarser scale of habitat detail than is available for the UK seabed. In recognition that impacts from a displacement of fishing effort occurring outside of MPAs can have an impact on features within MPAs, a “wider-seas” and “whole-sites” approach was used to assess the sensitivity of benthic habitats to fishing activities for the UK’s EEZ (Exclusive Economic Zone). The whole-sites and wider-seas approach means that currently protected features were not considered in isolation, but that the connectivity between benthic habitats were considered to provide a holistic overview the spatial distributions of fishing related impacts on the benthic habitat. Natural England holds a bespoke dataset which details potential fine-scale habtiats (EUNIS level 4 - 6) which occur within the broader habitat categories (EUNIS level 1 - 3) within the subbiogeographical sea regions around England from 0 to 12 NM offshore. The bespoke dataset was informed through expert consultation with Dr Keith Hiscock (Hiscock, K. 2016). The objective of this project was to map the spatial distribution of sensitive benthic habitats in relation to 39 pressures caused by fishing activities in the UK’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). The study area includes the wider seas (outside of MPAs) to provide evidence of sensitive habitats which may be affected by a displacement of fishing pressures arising from different scenarios of EU Exit. Previous studies have developed tools to predict the impacts of fishing effort displacement, which forecast a change in fishing effort displacement (Bastardie, Nielsen, and Miethe 2013). This project did not attempt to predict a change in fishing activity given the significant uncertainty and complexity in how Brexit would affect fishing opportunities and regulations in the UK. In this study habitat sensitivity to standardised pressures from various fishing activity were mapped as a precautionary approach given the manifold uncertainties associated with fishing displacement arising from Brexit, such as how trade negotiations may influence fishing rights allocations. Previous work which have mapped benthic habitat sensitivity have used a different approach . Broad-scale benthic habitat and A case study was developed to explore the potential use of benthic habitat sensitivity models to help inform NE of potential impacts ion the marine environment. In this report a case study was developed to inspect the potential application of the habitat sensitivity mapping in relation to spatial maps of fishing activity. Fishing activities have had profound effects on the UK’s marine ecosystem, of which bottom towed fishing gears is one of the most damaging activities which altered benthic habitats, composition and trophic structure of fish and invertebrate communities over the last century of industrial fishing (M. J. Kaiser et al. 1998; S. Jennings et al. 2001; J. G. Hiddink et al. 2006; H. M. Tillin et al. 2006; Thurstan, Brockington, and Roberts 2010). The spatial overlap of benthic habitat sensitivity maps and the distribution of fishing related dredging activities were compared to evaluate the use of sensitivity mapping as a tool to inform management of options to minimise the impacts of a the spatial distribution of fishing activities. The habitat sensitivity maps were therefore evaluated as an data set to inform conservation advice in the event of displacement of fishing effort. The ability of the tool to identify recently non-fished sensitive benthic habitats were explored, as a means to inform spatial planning in the UK’s EEZ. 1.0.0.1 Remove: The equitable redistribution of marine resources, such as fishing quota allocation, remains a key challenge to resource managers, for example. (Halpern, Gaines, and Warner 2004). The remit of NE’s statutory powers : National National Reserves (NNRs) in England, including terrestrial and marine environment. In the marine environment, NNRs include special Protected Areas (SPAs), Special Areas of Conservation (SACs), Marine Conservation Zones (MCZs), collectively referred to as Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) hereafter. All MPAs in the England are currently multi-use areas, within which protected features exist. Remove: It is therefore critical for marine resource managers to understand the distribution of fishing impacts in relation to the distribution the habitats and species to minimise damage to UK marine ecosystems. It is therefore imperative that marine environment and fisheries bodies make the necessary provisions to minimise potential damage arising from a change in fishing regulation following Brexit. "],
["methods.html", "2 Methods 2.1 Study Area", " 2 Methods 2.1 Study Area Marine habitat sensitivity maps were generated for the United Kingdom’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), from the shoreline to 200 NM offshore [Figure 1]!(english_waters). The sensitivity maps were generated in two steps, first for 0 - 12 NM offshore for English territorial waters, and second, comprising both the 12 - 200 NM English offshore and 0 - 200 NM for devolved administrations. The habitat sensitivity maps were therefore generated independently for these adjacent geographical areas. The areas were treated independently as Natural England holds fine-scale data on the composition of the benthic habitat in 0 - 12 NM in England which was not available for the offshore (12 - 200 NM) English waters and 0 - 200 NM for Devolved Administrations at the time of writing. The fine-scale information on habitat composition was utilised in an additional step within the R modelling routines, which allowed biotope prediction within mapped broader scale habitats. The biotope level habitat information was obtained from additional data and expert validation which describes the likely biotopes within subbiogeographic regions within English waters insert a map of subbiogeogrpahic regions. (This fine-scale habitat information when NE provides statutory advice, and is therefore well established within the organisations day to day working.)

The two data sources share a common unique identifier which refers to the habitat category and could therefore be joined to associate the sensitivity of habitat categories to the mapped habitat categories. 2.1.1.1 1. Marine habitat map The benthic habitat map used by NE (Marine_Evidence_Base_Internal.gdb, layer = BSH), was used as the basis to inform the spatial distribution of benthic habitats around within the UK’s EEZ for this project. The habitat categories contained within NE’s habitat map are based on the European Nature Information System (EUNIS) classification developed in conjunction with the JNCC (???; ???). TO DO: Get detail from Ian/Tim on the habitat map - is there a NE document to reference? 2.1.1.1.1 The EUNIS habitat classification system The EUNIS benthic habitat categories is a hierarchical system within which fine-scale habitat categories are nested within broader scale habitat categories, referred to as EUNIS levels. At the top of the hierarchical classification system, the broadest definition of habitat corresponds, e.g. “Marine”, to EUNIS level 1. At higher EUNIS values, the amount of thematic detail about the habitat increases progressively, for example, EUNIS level 2: A1 : Littoral rock and other hard substrata, EUNIS level 3: A1.1 : High energy littoral rock, EUNIS level 4: A1.11 : Mussel and/or barnacle communities, EUNIS level 5: A1.113 : Semibalanus balanoides on exposed to moderately exposed or vertical sheltered eulittoral rock, EUNIS level 6: A1.1132 : Semibalanus balanoides, Fucus vesiculosus and red seaweeds on exposed to moderately exposed eulittoral rock. See the EUNIS-webpage for more examples on the hierarchical view of the EUNIS habitat classification system. The habitat map was comprised habitat categories which were of different EUNIS levels (2 - 6). The differences in the habitat categories (EUNIS levels) is a result of different amounts of data available for the different areas across the EEZ. The development of the habitat is an ongoing process which updates the habitat maps and habitat classification system as new information becomes available. As such, there is variability in the amount of detail about the habitat (substrate and benthos), as well as variability in confidence between the mapped areas (referred to as polygons hereafter). The habitat map is therefore comprised of a patchwork of polygons which may differ in their shape, area and the habitat category (and EUNIS level) which they represent, as well as the level of confidence with which the habitat was category was assigned to it. The confidence associated with habitat classification of each polygon is represented by a MESH (Mapping European Seabed Habitats) score (Annex MESH confidence). MESH scores are derived from the confidence associated with different data sources used to inform the classification of the habitat category assigned to a polygon. The data sources used to generate the benthic habitat map are based on a variety of methods and data sources, such as remote sensing, side-scan sonar, sediment grabs and SCUBA-diver surveys. The EUNIS benthic habitat categories which appear on the habitat map were associated with habitat categories contained within the sensitivity assessment database, which were used together to derive sensitivity maps for benthic habitat. 2.1.1.2 2. Sensitivity assessments Sensitivity assessments of each benthic habitat categories has been carried out for most EUNIS habitats, and are publicly available on The Marine Life Information Network’s (MarLIN) website.The sensitivity assessments are based upon the MarESA (H. Tillin and Tyler-Walters 2014) methods in which the EUNIS habitats were assessed against 39 standardised pressures for each activity (Annex Activities and Pressures). The ten fishing activities in the AoO database were included in this project (Table 1). The pressures are standardised according to benchmarks, for which the benchmark value is defined at which point an effect is expected (H. Tillin and Tyler-Walters 2014). The 39 pressures include the 36 OSPAR standardised pressures and an additional three which allow specifying direction of a pressure rather than simply stating a change (Table 2). For example instead of one pressure stating a change of 0.5&amp;deg C, two separate pressures are included stating an increase of 0.5° C and another a decrease of 0.5° C. For details about the benchmarks please see Tillin et al (2014). One of six levels of sensitivity are assigned to each habitat category in relation to the each of the 39 pressures (Table 3).
