abstract: "The variety of benthic habitats in English waters differ in their degree of senstivity to pressures from fishing activities. Infomration on the spatial distribution of sensitive benthic habiats in is therefore an essential dataset to inform  management of fishing activities in English waters. This project aimed to delineate the geographical distribution of the benthic habitat sensitivity to fishing activities that impact the seabed in England's waters to illustrate their potential use to inform decisions in the marine environment. A script was developed in R statistical software to automate the process of assiginging fine-scale habitats and their sensitivities to the broader-scale habtits within which they occur, within each of the sub-biogeoregions in English seas from 0 - 200 NM offshore. Two confidence estimates error associated to the outputs, namely the accuracy of the underlying habitat map, 2) the confidence of the sensitivty assessment of the habitat itself. A case study was developed to illustrate the application of benthic habitats sensitivity maps as an evidence base which can inform marine management decisions. In the case study, the spatial distribution of five areas with high levels (more than 10 passes between 2009 and 2014) of scallop dredging (considered the most damaging fishing activity on the seabed) were mapped and overlaid onto the habitat sensitivity maps for further analysis. Mapped outputs were produced for habitat sensitivity against three standadrised pressures, incluiding abrasion, penetration and siltation. Areas with relatively high levels of abrasive pressure from scallop dredging in the inshore (0 - 12 NM) were shown to overlap with habitat of which  58 % were of low sensitivity, a third of of medium sensitivity and a further 9 % of high sensitivity. In the offshore (12 - 200 NM) the overlap with abrasion from dredging was 96 % of with low sensitivity habitat, and the remaining 4 % overlapped with habitat with levels of medium sensitivity. Seven habitat types with high levels of sensitivty were identified, including [Phymatolithon calcareum] maerl beds in infralittoral clean gravel or coarse sand. Variability in sensitivity of habitat within dredged areas suggests that management measuyres may be able to improve impacts on the seabed within dredged areas. Furthermore, the outputs provide an evidence base to direct a dispalcement of fishing effort away from the most sensitive benthic habitas."

# Introduction

Delineating the geographical distribution of habitat sensitivity has been identified as critical dataset for managing human activities on the marine environment [@baxSeabedHabitatSoutheastern2001]. The sensitivity of marine habitats have previously been defined as sensitivity as: *"The intolerance of a species or habitat to damage from an external factor and the time taken for its subsequent recovery"*,  [Laffoley et al. (2000); Tyler-Walters & Hiscock (2005)](https://www.marlin.ac.uk/sensitivity/sensitivity_rationale), or, *"the degree to which marine features respond to stresses, which are deviations of environmental conditions beyond the expected range"* [@zachariasSensitivityVulnerabilityMarine2005]. Overfishing and habitat loss are regarded as two of the main contributors to the degradation of the UK's marine environment [@walportForesightFutureSea2017]. Benthic habitats differ in their degree of sensitivity to  pressures arising from the various fishing activities [@dupliseaSizebasedModelImpacts2002; @hiddinkAssessingPredictingRelative2007], and therefore understanding the geographical distribution of habitat sensitivity is critical to inform spatial management of activities in the marine environment. 

Commercial fishing operations are wide spread throughout the United Kingdom, and is fished by both national and international fleets within the remits of the London Fisheries Convention (1964) and the Common Fishery Policy (CFP 1970s). The withdrawal of the UK from the European Union (EU exit/Brexit), [European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, section 20](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/16/section/20); [Article 50](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:12016M/TXT&from=EN), is likely to lead to change in fisheries regulations [@phillipsonSeaTroublesBrexit2018]. Leaving the EU may change how fish stocks are shared across political borders, quota allocation to EU-member states in the UK, and Total Allowable Catch (TAC) for different stocks among many other aspects related to managing the UK fishing grounds [@phillipsonSeaTroublesBrexit2018]. A change in fishing regulations and management may therefore have substantial ramifications fishing operations in the UK. The spatial distribution of fishing effort among various fishing metiers is a key element is likely to be influenced by a change in regulations [@vaughanFishingEffortDisplacement2017]. Previous research has shown that a displacement of fishing effort could lead to detrimental environmental and socio-economic effects e.g. [@stevensonSocioeconomicConsequencesFishing2013]. It is therefore important that the impact on the marine environment brought about by a displacement of fishing effort be considered prior to adopting new regulations or change in management practices [@vaughanFishingEffortDisplacement2017; @chollettQuantifyingSqueezingStretching2016]. Understanding the spatial distribution of bentic habitat senstivity is therefore essential to inform managers on the potential impact that a displacement of fishing effort may have on the seabed and thereby inform spatial management decisions.

## Previous sensitivity mapping work
Previous studies have developed tools to predict the impacts of fishing effort displacement, which forecast a change in the spatial distribution of fishing effort and the effort allocation between different fishing metiers [@bastardieDISPLACEDynamicIndividualbased2013]. This project did not attempt to predict fishing effort displacement given the significant uncertainty and complexity in how Brexit would affect fishing opportunities and regulations throughout English waters. Instead, models of benthic habitat sensitivity to pressures arising from fishing activities allow a responsive assessment of the by overlaying fishing activity data onto habitat sensitivity models. The sensitivity mapping is a precautionary approach which could then be used to assess potential impacts from change in marine activities as they happen or as they are proposed. This response as opposed to predictive approach was preferred due to the multitude of uncertainties associated with fishing displacement and other activities in the marine environment arising from EU exit.
<br>
Previous attempts to use quantitative methods to delineate benthic habitat sensitivity were limited by the level of detail about the underlying benthic habitat upon which fishing activities impact. These studies have assumed that benthic habitat were comprised of four broad-scale categories, such as mud, muddy sand, sand and gravel. Current quantitative models therefore do not consider differences in living structures occurring within these habitats. These models are therefore likely to over- or under-estimate the sensitivity of fine-scale habitats within these very broad definitions of habitat. Alternative methods using score based or expert judged systems  to map out geographical distribution of habitat sensitivity e.g. [@tillinAssessingSensitivitySubtidal2014; @zachariasSensitivityVulnerabilityMarine2005] have been criticized for not being quantitative, and therefore not repeatable [@dupliseaSizebasedModelImpacts2002; @hiddinkAssessingPredictingRelative2007]. Despite this limitation, both quantitative and scored based systems of habitat sensitivity have commonly been based upon the same central tenet of resilience to pressures, and standardization of the pressures [@robertsReviewExistingApproaches2010].

## Motivation
## Natural England's role in the marine environment and the wider seas and whole-site approach
Natural England (NE) provides statutory conservation advice on operations in English Territorial Waters (from the shore to 12 NM offshore) to Defra (Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs), regulators and developers. Natural England's statutory remit in the marine environment is principally directed towards protected habitats and species within English Territorial Waters, known as designated features. Designated habitat features, as used by Natural England, are represented at an intermediate scale of detail, equivalent to EUNIS level 3. Natural England's conservation advice is therefore limited to a subset of the area of English Territorial Waters, and provided at a coarser scale of habitat detail than is available for a substantial area of the UK seabed. In many cases this remit relates to Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) and the features designated for protection within them. In recognition that impacts from a displacement of fishing effort occurring outside of MPAs can have an impact on features within MPAs, a "wider-seas" and "whole-sites" approach was used in this project to assess the sensitivity of benthic habitats to fishing activities in English waters. The whole-sites and wider-seas approach means that currently protected features were not considered in isolation, but that the connectivity between benthic habitats were considered to provide a holistic overview the spatial distributions of fishing related impacts on the benthic habitat.

## Project aims
The overarching aim of this project was to map the spatial distribution of sensitivity of fine-scale benthic habitats (EUNIS level 4 - 6) in relation to 39 pressures caused by ten fishing activities within English waters. The study area includes the wider-seas (outside of MPAs) to provide evidence of sensitive habitats which may be affected by a displacement of fishing pressures arising from different scenarios of EU Exit. The large amount of possible combinations of fishing activities and pressures, were distilled into a case study for this report to showcase a few key outputs and analyses as a proof of concept to illustrate the potential application of habitat sensitivity maps as essential data to inform decision making in the marine environment.

 

**Attention for Duncan, Mark:** *Is it worth making a clearer connection between the work and NE, and how it relates to others, or shall we leave that for the discussion? Any need to mention that DEFRA commisioned NE to undertake the work the the 200 NM?  This paragraph below is aimed to reflect NE's role, and venturing into the 200 NM offshore, but you may wish to check it over carefully to ensure it is politically sensitive. Or don't we need this paragraph at all?:* 
## Sensitity maps extending into the English offshore
Natural England also provides advice out to 200 NM offshore for renewable energy through the delegation of responsibility from the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC). JNCC provides conservation advice on fishing activities outside of territorial waters in English waters to Defra. 

In essence, this project used existing benthic habitat maps and sensitivity assessments of benthic habitat to derive maps of benthic habitat sensitivity for various pressures arising from ten fishing activities. The benthic habitat sensitivity assessments used in this project is the data set also used to inform Natural England's Conservation Advice (Advice on Operations) for designated features, including benthic habitats and species. The habitat sensitivity assessments are comprised of three principal components, namely 1) habitat, 2) activity, and 3) pressure. See the Background section for more information on each of these components, and how sensitivity scores are derived following the MarESA protocol [@tyler-waltersMarineEvidencebasedSensitivity2018] as used by Natural England. **Attention Mark and Duncan - I have moved the section further describing how sensitivity assessments into a Background, i.e out of the Introduction, as it is long, and detailed - and probably only of interest to a few who would like to understand the working in greater detail - happy to reconsider if you think it is important to include it here**

## Habitat
Benthic habitats as used in this study were comprised from the substratum and the community of organisms adhered to or living in close contact to the seabed. The benthic habitat categories used by Natural England (and therefore in this study) is based on the pan-European adopted habitat classification system, known as the European Nature Information System (EUNIS). See the background section for more detail on the EUNIS habitat classification system.

## Key modelling challenges
Information on the sensitivity of benthic marine habitats and habitat maps are routinely updated every six months. Furthermore, the large number of combinations of activities and pressures which impact the wide variety of benthic habitat types to a diffrent degree means that reating the mapping proces with each iterative update of the underlying data is resource intensive. In this project a script was developed in R statistical to automate the developed habitat sensivity maps to all activities and pressures for which sensitivity assessments were available.

Habitat maps for the UK span the full set of EUNIS levels (1 - 6), while habiat sensitivity assessments held by Natural England were limited EUNIs levels 4 - 6. This mismatch between the assessed habiats and mapped habitats was addressed using predictive fine-scale habitat (EUNIS levels 4 - 6) modelling within broad-scale habitats (EUNIS levels 1 - 3). Predictive habitat assignment was based on a dataset which details potential fine-scale habitats which occur within the broader habitat categories within the sub-biogeographical sea regions in the inshore waters of England from 0 to 12 NM. This sub-biogeoregional habitat dataset was based on previous work commisioned to the Marine Biological Association which uses a combination of experrt opinion and emperical data [@hiscockAssigningEUNISClassification2016]. There is currently similar work commissioned by JNCC which is identifying fine-scale habitats within broad-scale habits in the offshore (12 - 200 NM). The latter data set will become incorporated into the overall data set in due course, but was not ready for implementation at the time of writing. 

## Case study
In this report a case study was developed to inspect the application of the habitat sensitivity mapping in relation to spatial distribution of fishing activity. The aims of the case study, and the report, were to identify the amount of sensitive benthic habitat and the type of benthic habitats currently impacted upon by scallop dredging activities within English waters.
<br>
Fishing activities have had profound effects on the UK's marine ecosystem, of which bottom towed fishing gears is one of the most damaging activities which have altered benthic habitats, composition and trophic structure of fish and invertebrate communities over the last century of industrial fishing [@kaiserChangesMegafaunalBenthic1998; @jenningsImpactsTrawlingDisturbance2001; @hiddinkCumulativeImpactsSeabed2006; @tillinChronicBottomTrawling2006; @thurstanEffects118Years2010]. Bottom towed fishing gears impact the habitat through penetration of the seabed, abrasion as the gear is being towed, and sedimentation caused in the wake of the towed gear [@oneillPhysicalImpactTowed2016]. 

The impact of dredge fishery targeting King (*Pecten maximus*) and Queen scallops (*Aequipecten opercularis*) on sensitive benthic habitat is of particular concern because it is the most valuable single species fishery [@lawlerAssessmentScallopStock2019], and does not have Total Allowable Catch (TAC) or quota limits [@curtisUKKingScallop2016]. The UK's king scallop firshery is managed by setting minimum landing sizes, and regulations which limits the effort, restrict the number of dredges per vessel, specify gear restrictions, and close off areas to the fishery [@curtisUKKingScallop2016; @lawlerAssessmentScallopStock2019]. The gear specifications for this fishery require that the Newhaven dredge (Newhaven dredges are used to capture scallops in the UK) to have between 6 and 9 teeth on the dredge bar, teeth to be less than 22 mm in length, and dredges should weigh no more than 150 kgs, along wit further specifications according to the [The Scallop Fishing (England) Order 2012](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2012/2283/article/3/made). Towed scallop dredges cause significant long-term degradation of the benthic habitat and the associated invertebrate communities [@howarthDredgeFisheryScallops2014] in a wide range of habitats, including soft sediment and hard benthic habitat substrates [@currieImpactsEfficiencyScallop1999; @hall-spencerScallopDredgingHas2000; @jenkinsImpactScallopDredging2001; @thrushImpactHabitatDisturbance1995] For these reasons, the sensitivity of benthic habitats to scallop dredging was focused on in the case study. The objective of the case study was to quantify the proportion of low, medium and highly sensitive habitat currently under three pressures, including, i) penetration, ii) abrasion and iii) sedimentation, from  scallop dredging. The types of sensitve benthic habitats that are impacted by scallop dredging are identified and discussed. Sensitivity to pressures from demersal trawling in English waters were mapped, to illustrate the wider application of habitat sensitivity maps, which were produced in this project, but not further analysed in this report. **Duncan, Mark - I think for proof of concept we can drop the other examples. Not sure the repetion adds much at this stage. If we had more up to date fishing activity data, with better discrimination between the fishing metiers, I think this would be a useful excercise, perhas for a journal article, but as the fishing activity data is limited, I think it will make the report longer than it needs to be to get the point accross. Let me know your thoughts, then we can drop this last statement, or think how we incorporate it succinctly.**



# Methods

## Study Area
Marine habitat sensitivity maps were generated for English waters from the shoreline to the edge of the continental shelf, approximately 200 NM offshore. The sensitivity maps were generated in two independent steps for two geographically adjacent areas: First for English Territorial Waters which include 0 - 12 NM offshore (area in light blue in Figure 1), and second, the 12 - 200 NM English offshore waters. these two areas are refereed to as inshore and offshore respectively from here on.

english_waters_img_path <- paste0(rpt_d,"/figures/official_waters.png")
knitr::include_graphics(english_waters_img_path, dpi  = 150)
```
<br>
The English inshore and offshore areas were treated independently as NE holds fine-scale data on the composition of the inshore benthic habitats which was not available for the offshore at the time of writing. The fine-scale information on habitat composition was utilised in an additional step within the R modelling routines, which allowed fine-scale habitat prediction within mapped broader-scale habitats. The biotope level habitat information was obtained from additional data and expert validation which describes the likely biotopes within sub-biogeoregions within English waters.

## Data sources
Two main data sets were used to map the sensitivities for the marine benthic habitats within English waters, including 1) habitat sensitivity assessments, and 2) a marine habitat map for the English waters. The two data sources share a common field namely, the EUNIS habitat code, in the datasets and could therefore be joined to associate the sensitivity of habitat categories to the mapped habitat categories.

### Sensitivity assessments
Sensitivity assessments of each benthic habitat categories have been carried out for most EUNIS habitats using the MarESA methods [@tillinAssessingSensitivitySubtidal2014] as part of NE's ongoing Advice on Operations programme. The sensitivity of the EUNIS habitats levels 4 to 6 were assessed against 39 standardised pressures for each activity. The ten fishing activities in the Advice on Operations database were included in this project (see Table 1). The pressures are standardised according to benchmarks, for which the benchmark value is defined at which point an effect caused by the pressure is expected [@tillinAssessingSensitivitySubtidal2014]. The 39 pressures include the 36 OSPAR standardised pressures and an additional three which allow specifying direction of a pressure rather than one parameter stating non-directional change (Table 2). For example, instead of one pressure stating a change of 0.5&deg; C, two separate pressures are included stating an increase of 0.5&deg; C and another a decrease of 0.5&deg; C. For details about the benchmarks please see Tillin et al  [-@tillinAssessingSensitivitySubtidal2014]. One of six levels of sensitivity were assigned to each habitat category in response to each of the 39 pressures, each with their own defined benchmark (Table 3). The sensitivity score was based on the resistance and resilience of the habitat. See the Annex for tables and [@tillinAssessingSensitivitySubtidal2014] for details about the MarESA methods.

#### Sensitivity assessments database
The sensitivity assessment data is also stored internally at NE in a Microsoft Access database, namely, PD_AoO.accdb. The Microsoft Access database, PD_AoO.accdb, was used as the source for the sensitivity assessments of the EUNIS habitats in relation to the activities and pressures in this project. The sensitivity assessments are used to inform NE's Advice on Operations (AoO), available as conservation advice packages to the public on the [Designated Sites View](https://designatedsites.naturalengland.org.uk/Marine/MarineSiteDetail.aspx?SiteCode=UKMCZ0045&SiteName=aln&countyCode=&responsiblePerson=&SeaArea=&IFCAArea=).

Sensitivity confidence assessments provide an indication of the level of confidence associated with each sensitivity assessment using the MarESA methods. The confidence assessments provides three types of confidence assessments, Quality of Evidence (QoE), Applicability of Evidence (AoE) and Degree of concordance between Evidence (DoE). Each of these confidence assessments were carried out for each of the sensitivity components, namely, Resistance, Resilience and Sensitivity. The QoE provides a measure regard for the origin of the evidence, e.g. peer review journal article, grey literature, expert opinion. The AoE provides a measure of how realistic is it for a given pressure to impact upon a habitat. The DoE provides a measure of the agreement between different evidence sources. The higher the confidence score, the greater the level of confidence in the assessment.

Only the quality of evidence (QoE) for overall sensitivity was displayed as a map in this study, but all measures are available for mapping. No attempt was made to amalgamate confidence indices into single measures, as what they represent becomes lost when doing so, especially if this were to be combined with the spatial confidence of the habitat map.

#### Marine habitat map
The benthic habitat map used by NE (Marine_Evidence_Base_Internal.gdb, layer = BSH), was used as the basis to inform the spatial distribution of benthic habitats within English waters for this project. The habitat categories contained within NE's habitat map are based on the EUNIS classification developed in conjunction with the JNCC [@daviesEUNISHabitatClassification2004; @galparsoroUsingEUNISHabitat2012]. The habitat map is continuously updated as new information on habitat becomes available following a well defined process between NE and JNCC. The extent of the habitat map was: -24.2816553949999729,47.9878704700000753 : 3.7191888160000417,64.0702531440000485, in datum World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84). The habitat map included over a million (1,207,497) polygons, each which have previously been attributed with a habitat type category following the [EUNIS habitat classification](https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/eunis-habitat-classification). The map below shows the variety of habitats, and the differences in the levels of EUNIS habitats. The map also shows that more than one type of habitat may be associated with a given polygon. In this study, only the habitat category (EUNIS code) appearing first in the attribute table where a list of possible habitats were entered in field "HAB_TYPE" was used in this study. Attempting to create sensitivity maps for all possible habitat types listed in the "HAB_TYPE" column in the attribute table was beyond the scope of this project and would result in significant delays. The habitat type (EUNIS Code) listed first under "HAB_TYPE" in the attribute table was used as it was the most likely habitat or the most abundant within the polygon (Timothy Fegan, Lead Advisor, Marine GI, Evidence Services NE, personal comment). For example, if a polygon had EUNIS code A1.1/A1.2, only A1.1 would have been used. See the habitat map below for UK, and the legend which shows a sample from the "HAB_TYPE" column (Figure 2).

The EUNIS benthic habitat categories which appear on the habitat map were associated with habitat categories contained within the sensitivity assessment database. By joining these datasets sensitivity maps for benthic habitat to the various pressures and activities were generated. The following steps were taken to produce the habitat sensitivity maps from the aforementioned data sources.
<br>
The habitat map was comprised habitat categories which were of different EUNIS levels (2 - 6). The differences in the habitat categories (EUNIS levels) is a result of different amounts of data available for the different areas in English waters. The habitat map and habitat classification system is updated by NE and JNCC as new information becomes available. As such, there is variability in the amount of detail about the habitat (substrate and benthos), as well as variability in confidence between the mapped areas (referred to as polygons hereafter). The habitat map is therefore comprised of a patchwork of polygons which may differ in their shape, area and the habitat category (and EUNIS level) which they represent, as well as the level of confidence with which the habitat was category was assigned to it. The confidence associated with habitat classification of each polygon is represented by a MESH (Mapping European Seabed Habitats) score (*Annex MESH confidence*). MESH scores are derived from the confidence associated with different data sources used to inform the classification of the habitat category assigned to a polygon. The data sources used to generate the benthic habitat map are based on a variety of methods and data sources, such as remote sensing, side-scan sonar, sediment grabs and SCUBA-diver surveys. While The MESH confidence assessment applies directly to the sensitivity map, it is not explored further in this report, as it is the standard existing confidence assessment of habitat category assignment associated with the habitat map. The MESH score is included as a column in the outputs but not presented here.

### Addressing the mismatch in EUNIS habitat assessments and the habitat map.
A significant proportion (70 %) of the mapped area of inshore and offshore habitats corresponded to EUNIS habitat categories which have been assessed for sensitivity, but about 30% of the area included habitat categories which have not had not been assessed (EUNIS level 3 and lower). The main reason for this was the mismatch in the habitat categories included in the habitat map and those that have been assessed for sensitivity to pressures. The habitat map includes EUNIS level 2 - 6, while the assessments only cover EUNIS level 4 - 6. Approximately 70 % of the area of the UK waters was mapped at EUNIS level four,  approximately 70 % of the polygons constituting the habitat map for the UK were at EUNIS level three.

```

In order to remedy the mismatch of EUNIS levels between the map and the database, an approach was adopted in which the sensitivities of fine-scale habitats were assigned to the mapped polygons which did not have sensitivity assessments. This assignment of fine-scale habitats to broad-scale habitats within the inshore (0 - 12 NM) were done as follows:

### Integrating fine-scale benthic habitats within inshore sub-biogeoregions 
Fine-scale benthic habitats (EUNIS level 4 - 6) which are known to occur within sub-biogeoregions (Figure 4) within (0 - 12 NM) were identified based on expert opinion and validated using survey data in project for NE [@hiscockAssigningEUNISClassification2016]. The fine-scale habitats were then associated with the broad-scale habitats within each sub-biogeoregion, where the fine-scale habitat were 1) known to occur in the given sub-biogeoregion, and 2) a the assessed habitat is a "child" fine-scale habitat of a "parent" broad-scale habitat. i.e. the fine-scale habitat had to be related to the broad-scale habitat, such as a habitat with EUNIS code A5.12 is a parent of A5.127. Each broad-scale (parent) habitat could therefore have multiple fine-scale (child) habitats associated to it within the given sub-biogeoregion. The child habitat of the highest EUNIS level and the highest sensitivity was assigned to parent habitats to inform sensitivity assessments. Sensitivity assessments of higher EUNIS levels were therefore preferred over sensitivity assessments at lower levels, where available. This habitat category replacement was justified under the assumption that fine-scale habitats would provide a more realistic assessment of the true sensitivity to a pressure, than the lower EUNIS level (parent). This was based on the idea that an understanding of the sensitivity of benthic communities and the substrate would be more informative than sensitivity of the substrate alone. This information was not currently available for the offshore, but JNCC is working on such a project [@tillinAssiningEUNISClassification2017], and when the data becomes available, it will be incorporated in to the offshore model, as for the inshore.

### Data processing
GIS steps were required to split the original English waters habitat map into an inshore (0 - 12 NM) and offshore component (12 - 200 NM). All other technical data manipulation was carried out using the R statistical environment in effort to make the work repeatable and provide instant results following updates to the sensitivity assessment database (PD_AoO.accdb) or updates to the benthic habitat map.

### GIS steps 
Geoprocessing tools in QGIS was used for the production of the inshore (0 - 12 NM) and offshore (12 - 200 NM) areas.
The habitat map (master copy - Marine_Evidence_Base_Internal.gdb) was copied, and (step 1) clipped (using the DIFFERENCE geoprocessing tool in QGIS) keeping only the area inside the English 12 NM boundary to create the basis for the inshore habitat map. The sub-biogeoregional shapefile was used to (step 2) associate the sub-biogeoregions (subbiogeoregions_clipped12nm_joined_sbgr_PH_wgs84.shp) to the individual polygons comprising the inshore habitat map, using INTERSECT geoprocessing tool in QGIS. Outputs were stored as geopackage files to explore the use of open source standard file formats (and tools) in order to promote their use within the organisation. (Geopackages are GIS files which contain a database within which the information (attributes) are associated with the individual habitat polygons.)
<br>
The files used to generate the inshore (inside 12NM) habitat map are specified below:
Step 1 & 2:
<br>
```{r GI_filenames, echo=FALSE}
print("Marine_Evidence_Base_Internal.gdb  DIFFERENCE with mask_minus_12nm_and_land_WGS84.shp
--> Input_Polys_WGS84_Internal_BGR_inside_12nm.gpkg")
 #------------

print("Input_Polys_WGS84_Internal_BGR_inside_12nm.gpkg INTERSECT with subbiogeoregions_clipped12nm_joined_sbgr_PH_wgs84.shp
--> sbgr_input_poly_wgs84_internal_bgr_inside_12nm.gpkg")
```
<br>

The GIS process for the inshore map can be depicted in flow diagram as follows, where the files shown above were the input to the GI geoprocessing tools shown below.

<br>

```{r GI_process, fig.cap="Figure 6. The GIS processes followed to prepare the data set prior to implementing the R scripts.", echo =FALSE}
rpt_d <- getwd()
gis_process_path <- paste0(rpt_d,"/figures/gis_process_map.png")
knitr::include_graphics(gis_process_path, dpi = 150)

```
<br>
The offshore habitat map was prepared by geoprocessing tools in QGIS (DIFFERENCE), which eliminated the areas outside of English and Welsh offshore waters, as well as the area inside the English 12 NM boundary, from the UK waters. A column was added to the offshore dataset (built into the R script described below), equivalent to the sub-biogeoregion column added to the inshore habitat map, but here labelling all polygons as "offshore", to allow merging of the end products. The files used for the offshore data layer are specified below.
<br>

```{r GI_offshore_files, echo=FALSE, , out.extra='style="background-color: #FFFFFF; padding:20px; display: inline-block;"'}
print("Offshore (outside 12 NM) habitat map
F:/copy_data/Marine_Evidence_Base_Internal.gdb → CLIP (Difference) with D:/projects/fishing_displacement/2_subprojects_and_data/2_GIS_DATA/masks/mask_minus_12nm_and_land.shp")
```

<br>

### R-code steps
All programming to generate habitat sensitivity layers was carried out using R. The code files are stored on NE's GitHub [webpage](https://github.com/naturalengland/marine_biotope_sensitivity). Here only the high-level overview of how the code works is described. Details about what each section of code does is broadly described in the Annex, and specific details are described within each R-file. The inshore and offshore used two separate sets of code, and run independently, after they were split using the GIS described above. The R scripts developed for processing the inshore and offshore data follow the same steps as described below. In essence the R-code reads the sensitivity assessments (and associated confidence scores) and GIS data into the R statistical environment (an instance of the R programme).In the R environment the GIS data are associated with the sensitivity assessments. In the offshore the R-code evaluates the fine-scale habitats which may occur within broad-scale habitats, and associates the individual mapped habitat polygons to the fine-scale habitat assessments with the highest sensitivity score within each sub-biogeoregion. The process is repeated for the offshore data, but the code finds the fine-scale "child" benthic habitat with the highest sensitivity for each mapped broad-scale habitat within the entire offshore area. At this stage no sub-biogeoregional information was included in the offshore area and these assessments are likely to over-estimate sensitivity. The data a sets were finally stored as geopackages for the inshore and offshore respectively. 

## Case Study
### Fishing activity data investigation
The spatial match of scallop dredging activity was compared to the distribution of sensitive habitats. The habitat sensitivity map to abrasion (pressure code D6) from dredging (activity code Z5) in the inshore area was used. Offshore sensitivity may be added in due course once JNCC data is incorporated in the analysis. The aggregated dredging activity between 2013-2014 stored in file "Fishermap_JNCC_NE/MMO_UK_VMS_Fishing_Activity.gdb" was used as a realistic and recent example of the geographic distribution of dredging pressure in the English waters. The above dredging activity data set contains scallop dredging, hand-drawn dredging data, but the latter two only apply to the shoreline-area. Areas known for other kinds of dredging activity, such as hydraulic dredging at The Wash were excluded after the identification of areas with relatively high fishing pressure in the Results. Areas with relatively high levels of dredging activity were identified by setting a minimum threshold of including cells from the activity map where dredging activity exceeded 20 % of the highest activity value. This was done to restrict the area of investigation to distinct (and disjointed) areas where fishing pressure was greatest. If no cut-off value was applied, the areas become very large and connected along the inshore 12NM boundary. See below for short description of this GIS process.

```{r gis_process_aoi, echo=FALSE}
print("GIS process to establish areas of high levels of fishing activity:")
cat("GIS processs: Select (filter) values above 10.82 (drdge passes per year) from MMO_UK_VMS_Fishing_Activity.gdb, and group each of remaining grid-squares with an area of interest identifier, aoi field in the attribute table. Then disolve the filtered file based on aoi field, removing non-selected grid-squares. Thirdly, clip the habitat sensitivity map with the aoi-file to establish the habitat sensitivity within areas of high fishing activity.")
#Can be exported and anlaysed further (but may wish to intersect with the grid again to obtain finer grained values).

```

### Identifying scalloping areas with high levels of dredging activity.
A substantial inshore area was associated with relatively high levels of dredging activity.  The offshore areas between Worthing and Eastbourne was the largest contiguous area with relatively high levels (>10.8) of dredging activity. Dredging around this area was assumed to be largely focused on scallop dredging, as a large number of scallop dredgers operate from Shoreham Harbour, near Worthing. The Shoreham scallop dredgers effort was predominantly focused in the offshore area (Figure 6). Other areas with relatively high levels of dredging activity thought to be scallop dredging include Portsmouth, Brixham which had highest activity levels inshore. A large area between Falmouth and Plymouth had relatively high levels of dredging activity associated within the inshore area. There was an area with relatively high levels of dredging activity straddled across the inshore and the offshore between Newlyn and the Isles of Scilly. The offshore area between Isle of Man and Blackpool in the Irish Sea was another area with relatively high levels of scallop dredging. These core areas of interest were validated using MMO landings data [website](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/marine-management-organisation). 

```{r seafish, echo = FALSE}
#fig.cap="Figure taken from Landings distribution of fish in the UK."

Future reports should include more information on background of Fishermap_JNCC_NE\MMO_UK_VMS_Fishing_Activity.gdb data to spell out details around the layer; and describe the values on the table.* 
```
<br>
### Habitat sensitivity inside areas with high dredging activity

The habitat sensitivity within areas of high scallop dredging activity was analysed using a 100 by 100m grid of randomly stratified points within each high activity area. The point-grid was overlaid onto the inshore and offshore benthic habitat sensitivity maps in a GIS, and the underlying habitat sensitivity and fishing activity was obtained where the points intersected these maps.

# Results

## Sensitivity mapping
In total about 154 valid combinations of benthic habitat sensitivity assessments against 39 pressures from each the ten fishing activities, for the inshore and for the offshore respectively. I.e. including both inshore and offshore 308 habitat sensitivity maps. Not all activities-pressure-habitat combinations have valid interactions, and therefore the total is not 390 per inshore/offshore data set. These mappable data columns were accompanied by the same number of confidence assessments and assessed fine-scale habitat type (child of broader habitat type). In total 462 new columns were added to the habitat map, each representing either a sensitivity to a activity pressure combination, the associated fine-scale habitat, and the confidence of the sensitivity assessment. The mappable data columns were stored in two files, one for the offshore, and another for the inshore as geopackages. The geopackages were vector based, and mirror the spatial resolution and habitat detail of the benthic habitat map, as the mappable columns become attached to the existing habitat map.

The R script which generates the mappable data set has the capability to instantly produce similar data sets for 18 operations (for the inshore and offshore). The R scripts were not run for all operations, as the outputs would require a significant amount of data storage space (approximately 160 GB). The fact that these maps can and should be updated as new data becomes incorporated into the database and habitat map was sufficient reason to produce the maps only as and when needed the outputs for other activities and operations are required. 
In the offshore 154 sensitivity maps were produced, for the 10 fishing activities included in NE's conservation advice.

## Case study results

The spatial distribution of benthic habitat sensitivity to abrasion from dredging is shown in Figure 6. The offshore is characterized by large contiguous (connected) areas of medium or low level sensitivity. The inshore benthic habitat is characterized by a patchwork of habitat sensitivities including high to low sensitive habitats. For example, the offshore area in the English Channel is dominated by low sensitivity habitat, while the inshore area in the English Channel has several areas of medium to high sensitivity, such as Skerries Bank, and reef areas off Plymouth.

### Overview of inshore and offshore habitat sensitivity
Sub-biogeoregion 2c in the Southern North Sea and sub-biogeoregion 5 in the Irish Sea had the greatest proportional area of highly sensitive habitats, each covering about 1.6 % of the total inshore area. Large areas in sub-biogeoregions 1a and 1b in the northern North Sea had medium sensitivity, and each covered over 30 % of the total inshore area.
<br>
The majority of the total area of the offshore marine environment (53.2 %) was dominated by medium level sensitivity to abrasion from dredging. Almost 28.8 % percent of the total offshore area was not assessed, and the remaining area was comprised of 16.6 % low sensitivity and 1.2 % high sensitivity.

### Example of information extractable at a fine-scale:

#### Inshore polygons with high sensitivity
The largest inshore habitat polygon which had a high level of sensitivity and covered an area almost 1.6 % of the English Territorial Waters. This polygon had a habitat classification of sublittoral mixed sediments (A5.4), which was assessed as fine-scale habitat category *Cerianthus lloydii* and other burrowing anemones in circalittoral muddy mixed sediment (A5.441) against dredging pressure  (Z10_5)from abrasion pressure (D6). This fine-scale habitat type had a high level of sensitivity with low degree of confidence in the assessment (Quality of Evidence). The parent habitat type (A5.4) had a medium to high degree of confidence associated with a MESH score  of 66 out of 100. Future analysis will look at contiguous areas (connected polygons) using habitat patch statistics.

#### Inshore polygons which were not sensitive
The largest non-sensitive area to abrasion from dredging was a polygon off Margate Longsands with habitat type A5.137, Dense *Lanice conchilega* and other polychaetes in tide-swept infralittoral sand and mixed gravelly sand. The assessment had a high level of confidence based on the Quality of the Evidence and a high degree of confidence in the mapped habitat type (MESH score 81). See the sensitivity assessment on the [MarLIN webpage]( https://www.marlin.ac.uk/habitats/detail/116) for more detailed information on the reasons for the non-sensitive habitat type outcome.

## Fine-scale habitats within broad-scale habitats

The outputs from the model provides the fine-scale (child) habitat (EUNIS level 4 - 6) which was used in the sensitivity assessment in the place of the broad-scale (parent) habitat (EUNIS level 2 - 3). The habitat codes which were assessed were therefore all EUNIS level 4 or above, as illustrated by Figure 9 showing a sample of habitat codes. Only the inshore habitat replacement is shown at this stage and the offshore will be added following JNCC commissioned project in which fine-scale habitats known to occur within broad-scale habitats are being assigned within each sub-biogeoregion [@tillinAssiningEUNISClassification2017]

## Confidence measure - Quality of Evidence
The confidence of the sensitivity assessments for the inshore and offshore based on the quality of the evidence (QOE) is shown in Figure 10. The confidence map showed that generally the quality of evidence was higher for habitats assessed in the inshore than offshore areas, but the offshore is subject to change following an update to the habitats used during assessments. The English channel generally had relatively high levels of confidence associated with sensitivity assessments.

## Case study: Scallop dredging activity in sensitive benthic habitat

Eight areas of interest were initially identified from the spatial distribution of dredging effort. From these eight areas, five areas were considered to largely represent high levels of scallop dredging, namely, 1) Worthing to Eastbourne, 2) Brixham, 3) Falmouth to Plymouth, 4) Newlyn to the Isles of Scilly, and 5) Isle of Mann to Blackpool. The Wash was characterized by having the highest levels of dredging activity in England, however this was thought to be largely based on hydraulic dredging and was therefore not considered further. The Solent area which also had high levels of dredging activity was removed from the study as it was thought not to be focused around scallop dredging. Cardigan Bay had high levels of dredging, but was not further considered as it is outside of English waters. The Isle of Mann was included as this area straddled both Isle of Mann and UK waters (this may be removed if the area included is too contentious within NE's remit).

### Area per habitat sensitivity in areas with high levels of fishing pressure. 
The habitats within areas of high levels of scallop dredging activity ranged from low to high levels of sensitivity to abrasion, and there were no insensitive benthic habitats within these areas, nor habitats which have either not been assessed or had insufficient data. Therefore, all areas currently within English scallop dredging areas were sensitive to abrasion to a varying degree.

<br>

The majority (58 %) of inshore habitats subject high levels of scallop dredging activity (more than 10 passes between 2009 and 2014) were of low sensitivity. A third of the inshore area consisted of habitats with medium sensitivity and a further 9 % of high levels of sensitivity to abrasion  caused by scallop dredging. In the offshore 96 % of sampling points in high levels of dredging overlapped with low sensitivity habitat, and the remaining 4 % overlapped with habitat with levels of sensitivity.

Eight habitat categories which were highly sensitive were impacted by scallop dredging, including EUNIS habitats A3.311,A4.111, A4.131, A4.231, A5.321, A5.421, A5.421, A5.441, A5.511 in the inshore. No highly sensitive habitats were impacted in the offshore (Table 8). Areas of low sensitivity were derivatives of EUNIS benthic habitat A5.1, such as A5.141 and A5.151, and similarly A5.2 and A5.4 (Table 8).

The largest concentration of highly sensitive habitats within scalloped dredged areas inside the 12 NM inshore boundary (mean = 4.83,0 +- 0.68 s.d.) and in the offshore (4.46 +- 0.5) areas were between Falmouth to Plymouth (Figure 13). The inshore sensitivity was informed by fine-scale benthic habitat A5.421 attributed to a large polygon on the habitat map officially classified as habitat type A5.4. *this suggests that these areas require careful scrutinity and ground truthing to ensure that the result is robust - overlay validation points to see if these habitats occur?*

# Discussion

The benthic habitat sensitivity maps to abrasive pressures from scallop dredging in English marine waters developed in the case study illustrated a potential application of sensitivity mapping as a starting point to managing a displacement fishing effort. While this study did not attempt to predict a displacement of fishing effort *per se*, it provided a spatial evidence base to inform the suitability and potential impacts arising from a displacement of fishing effort. Development of bespoke products, such as Figure 8, and permutations thereof for different pressures, such as penetration or siltation, and those arising from other fishing activities, such beam trawling holds under utilized potential not previously available on a spatial scale covering all English waters at the level biological community.

The case study showed that habitat sensitivity maps were able to identify the level of sensitivity and type of benthic habitat impacted in areas which are dredged for scallops. The value of the very high spatial resolution the habitat sensitivity maps developed in this study is shown by the high levels of variation of habitat sensitivity detected within each of the dredged areas. The variation in sensitivity detected within these dredged areas provides opportunity for strategic management intervention to reduce the impact on these highly sensitive habitats, by displacing that effort to areas where the habitats are more resilient and have the shorter times to recovery.A management strategy which minimises the amount of damaging activities on the seabed is critical to prevent significant long-term damage to habitats and change to benthic invertebrate communities.The ability to map sensitive areas therefore provides critical information to marine managers to inform and improve spatial management through regulations which restrict dredging activities to the habitat types that are least sensitive to fishing impacts.

## Confidence in the modelled habitats
The level of confidence that we have in the in the habitat sensitivity assessments is an important consideration which influences the ultimate use of the maps. Currently there are at least four measures of confidence associated with the maps, each indicating a different facet in which confidence is placed. The MESH score provided with the habitat map used is critical to take into consideration when carrying out an assessment to provide confidence in the geographical distribution of habitats. The measure of confidence in the assessment used in the this study, Quality of Evidence (QOE) provides a good indication of how well established the evidence is supporting the assessments, and can be further supplemented by confidence on the applicability of assessments and the degree of concordance between assessments. The confidence with which modelled fine-scale child habitats were assigned to broad-scale parent habitats has not yet been assessed, and requires updating in future. Existing benthic sample data could be used in future to improve confidence assessments in which fine-scale habitats are attributed to broad-scale habitats. There are however numerous of these expert judged fine-scale habitat associations which do not have empirical data to support the assignment. Future development of the habitat sensitivity maps will include this measure of confidence where it is available.

## Case study: Application of habitat sensitivity to scalloping
### Inshore benthic habitat senstivity
The results from this study showed that there were seven highly sensitive inshore benthic habitats which have been impacted on by scallop dredging activities. Three of these habitats included infra and sub-tidal circalittoral rock habitats with algal or invertebrate communities which are not compatible with scallop dredging gear, and would suffer significant damage if dredged. The remaining four highly sensitive benthic habitats were sedimentary characterised by annelid, crustacean or cnidarian invertebrate communities which are had slow recovery periods and high levels of mortality associated with abrasion from scallop dredging. Of particular concern were *Phymatolithon calcareum* mearl beds which have been shown to undergo significant long term declines with no recovery after 4 years following scallop dredging in a previous study in the English Channel [@hall-spencerScallopDredgingHas2000].

### Offshore benthic habitats
The lower than expected prevalence of highly sensitive offshore benthic habitats was surprising given the precautionary approach followed to determine fine-scale child habitats within broad-scale benthic habitats. The offshore associations of child to parent habitats were not restricted to fine-scale habitats known to occur within sub-biogeoregions, and the resulting sensitivity map for the offshore was therefore likely to over-estimate of the actual sensitivity. While the precautionary principal is essential for effective conservation, sub-biogeoregional restriction of fine-scale habitats will greatly improve the accuracy of the predicted fine-scale child habitats within the broad-scale habitats.The sub-biogeoregional mapping undertaken by JNCC along with the identification of likely fine-scale habitats within broad-scale habitats in the offshore [@tillinAssiningEUNISClassification2017]. Furthermore, greater accuracy of offshore habitat maps will improve the ability to identify areas with high levels of sensitivity, and the confidence with which conservation advice can be provided in the offshore.

## Activity data
Data on activity of fishing operations in the offshore and the inshore is essential to assess their relevant impacts on the benthic habitat. The fishing data used in this study were based on VMS data in English waters covering the period between 2009 and 2014, and will require updating to illustrate the present scenario. The data available to this study were received as aggregated into broad gear categories, such as dredging. Analyses of activity data in relation to the habitat sensitivity maps in this case study was therefore limited in the strategic information that managers could glean from the outputs. Higher resolution, both spatial and in terms of the fishing metiers will provide greater opportunity to make strategic fishery recommendations.  

It is important to account for the size of fishing vessels when assessing the likely impact that it may have on the habitat, over and above the habitat sensitivity. Small vessels (<10 m) typically tow 3 - 4 dredges per bar, while vessels larger than 20m are able to carry up  to 20 dredges per bar, thereby having a significantly larger footprint on the seabed [@curtisUKKingScallop2016]. The majority of the scallop fishing fleet dependent on scalloping for its main source of revenue is larger than 10m [@curtisUKKingScallop2016]. Given that the majority of vessels are larger than 10 m and that larger vessels are able to carry more dredges [@curtisUKKingScallop2016], there is clearly a need for a breakdown of activity data according to metier. 

The VMS data only includes vessels 12 m and larger, as vessels smaller than 12 m are not fitted with VMS devices. The smaller fishing fleet generally operates in the waters inshore from 12 NM boundary but is generally not well understood [@eneverMappingFishingEffort2017]. The inshore fishing fleet represent approximately 85 % of the English fishing fleet, and yet it is almost entirely under-reported. Previous efforts which mapped the fishing effort were based on qualitative descriptions from interviews with fishermen but these are becoming increasingly outdated and rely on qualitative data [@eneverMappingFishingEffort2017]. In order to understand the impacts that the inshore fishing fleet is having on the benthic substrate, higher resolution and quantitative data are required. 

In this study, areas considered to have high levels of scallop dredging activity inside them were those with  more than 10.8 passes between 2009 and 2014. The estimated areas impacted by scallop dredging are therefore likely to be significantly under-estimated, as a single dredge can cause damage to habitat; with the first dredge often doing the most damage (*insert reference*). More recent fishing activity data according broken down to metier was not available to the study within the timeframe that it was required owing to resource intesive data extraction and data leasing agreements required to obtain access to this data. Greater availability of fishing activity data is essential to improve the understanding of the likely impacts that this fishery has on the seabed.

## Future development of the research
Future application of this data could be used to identify a) sensitive and not-fished, and b) not-sensitive and not-fished areas, as a potential source to inform management of options which identifies the spatial distribution of fishing effort which would minimise the impact on the benthic habitat. The requirement is distribution models of King and Queen scallops in English waters, upon which these data can be overlaid. The development of species distribution models for King and Queen scallops are currently being undertaken in a joint project by the MMO and Cefas.

Species distribution models for these and other species will feed into a second phase of the project in which essential fish habitat (EFH)  which are currently only lightly impacted, or not impacted will be identified. A priority species list has been developed and assessed against the standardised activity and pressures database held by natural England. These sensitivity assessments of these species will be used in conjunction with habitat sensitivity to produce a comprehensive and holistic dataset to inform spatial distribution of fishing.

A follow up project will consider: 
A third project objective is the development of maps of the sensitivity distribution for 30 fish and shellfish species within UK waters to fishing related activities. These models are underpinned by sensitivity assessments carried out at set benchmarks, and coupled with species distribution models.

## Compare with quantitaive methods
This is fundamentally different from how recovery time is estimated using quantitative methods. Recovery as used in quantitative models follows a mathematical formula such as a modified Lotka–Volterra to estimate the based on the assumption that the recovery rate of organisms is uniform according to size and being soft or hard bodied organisms [dupliseaSizebasedModelImpacts2002].

## Application of habitat sensitivity to other oeprations
The United Kingdom's (UK) marine environment is of significant economic value, in which the exploitative activities and infrastructure development is constantly weighed up against their impacts on the environment [@walportForesightFutureSea2017]. The UK's marine environment is subject to a vast array of operations which impact the marine environment, such as fishing marine aggregate dredging, development of renewable energy and risks of pollution from oil spills among many others.

# Background
## EUNIS Habitat classification
 The EUNIS benthic habitat classification is a hierarchical system within which fine-scale habitat categories are nested within broader-scale habitat categories. The hierarchical tiers within the EUNIS classification is referred to as EUNIS levels. EUNIS level 1 is at the top of the hierarchical classification system where the broadest definition of habitat discerns the environments, such as marine habitat from other habitats like terrestrial or freshwater. The amount of thematic detail about the habitat increases progressively With an increase in the EUNIS level as shown in the example below: 

- EUNIS level 1: Environment : A: Marine,
- EUNIS level 2: Biological Zone: A1 : Littoral rock and other hard substrata,
- EUNIS level 3: Substrate: A1.1 : High energy littoral rock,
- EUNIS level 4: Broad community: A1.11 : Mussel and/or barnacle communities,
- EUNIS level 5: Biological assemblage A1.113 : *Semibalanus balanoides* on exposed to moderately exposed or vertical sheltered eulittoral rock,
- EUNIS level 6: Detailed biological assemblage A1.1132 : *Semibalanus balanoides*, *Fucus vesiculosus* and red seaweeds on exposed to moderately exposed eulittoral rock. 

The EUNIS classification system uses code to represent different habitats, which increase in the with an inceases with EUNIS level. The nested hierarchy dictates that a fine-scale habitat nested within broad-scale habitat share the same attributes as the preceeding EUNIS level (as shown in the example above). A fine-scale habitat nested within broad-scale habitat is referred to as "child" fine-scale habitat within a "parent" broad-scale habitat in this report, indicating this hierarchical and related relationship. Each parent habitat may therefore have multiple child habitats. Child habitats from the same parent hanitat will all share the same attributes with the parent habitat. *See the* [EUNIS-webpage](https://eunis.eea.europa.eu/habitats-code-browser.jsp) *for more examples on the hierarchical view of the EUNIS habitat classification system.* 

### Activity
Standardized categories of human activities to which pressures on the environment are associated. Activities are grouped within operations. An example of an operation would be commercial fishing, whereas an activity could be demersal trawling.

### Pressure
Pressure is the force of stress exerted by an activity on marine benthic habitats. Every activity may be associated with numerous pressures which act simultaneously on these habitats. The nature of the pressure is determined by the activity type, intensity and distribution [@robinsonMarineAssessmentMonitoring2010]. An example of pressures exerted by demersal trawling would include (among others) penetration, abrasion and sedimentation. Pressures are standardised according to a benchmark, which is a set level at which there are known effect and habitats or species. See the MarESA methods for more detail [@tyler-waltersMarineEvidencebasedSensitivity2018].

## Sensitivity assessments used by Natural England
Natural England's benthic habitat sensitivity assessments include 39 pressures associated with a 100 activities stemming from 18 operations in the marine environment. Sensitivity assessments used by NE are based on the MarESA methods [@tyler-waltersMarineEvidencebasedSensitivity2018]. In essence the MarESA sensitivity assessments are comprised of two components, namely 1) resistance and 2) resilience which are assessed to derive a sensitivity category from each assessment. The resistance is the ability of the substrate and the benthic community of organisms to withstand damage caused by a particular pressure associated with an activity. In other words, it is the likelihood of damage due to a pressure. The second component, resilience, is the time that it takes for the benthic community to regenerate and restore the productivity and/or biomass [@hiddinkAssessingPredictingRelative2007] to its former level prior to the impact. In the qualitative methods used by NE, resistance and resilience scores are assigned to each habitat category based on literature reviews or expert judgement. Cross-tabulation of the categorical scores of resistance and resilience are then used to determine the sensitivity category in the MarESA methods [@tyler-waltersMarineEvidencebasedSensitivity2018]. 

## Confidence scores of sensitivity assessments
A confidence score is then associated with the two components of each sensitivity assessment, and and overall confidence derived from that for the sensitivity assessment. The confidence score is based on the quality of the evidence and and its applicability to the assessment of the likely effects of a pressure on a given feature (species or habitat). The quality of the evidence is based on the reputability of the source, e.g. journal article, grey literature or expert opinion, and the level of agreement between the different sets of evidence [@tillinAssessingSensitivitySubtidal2014a; @davackAssessingSensitivitySeagrass2014].

The R-code steps to process the habitat assessment and GI data are outlined below.	

## R-code steps

```{r flowdiagram, fig.cap="Annex Figure 1. Flow diagram of data processing in R.",echo = FALSE}
fd_path <- "./figures/flowdiagram_20190502.png"
knitr::include_graphics(fd_path, dpi = 150)

```

The code is structured as a main script which calls sixteen helper functions to run the separate processes sequentially over 11 steps.
In the main script, the user provides input, such as the locality of the input data sources, e.g. Microsoft Access database, and habitat maps. Furthermore, the location of outputs generated, and the choice of file names. Once the user enters these inputs, the main body of the code can be run, where upon the user will be prompted to select one of the 18 Operations for which to generate habitat sensitivity maps. Once the user has entered their selection, the code runs without further user input requirements.

#### The eleven steps follow:
The main script now starts calling the helper functions, one  at a time, and passes on output from a previous step for further processing. It starts by 
1. Reading the desired section of data from the MS Access database, which it runs through a query to obtain a list of EUNIS habitat types and their sensitivity assessments. 
2. It then ranks the possible combinations of sensitivity scores from 1 - 6 based on the degree of their sensitivity, to allow selecting the greatest (maximum) sensitivity associated with a fine-scale habitat occurring within a broad-scale habitat, further down the process (see step 10). The ranks are then associated to the appropriate sensitivity category in the list of EUNIS-sensitivity assessments. A lists of unique combinations of sensitivities to each pressure (39) is then generated for each of the assessed EUNIS habitats, separately for each activity within the operation. ("act.press.list").
3. The GIS file (geodatabase) is read in either from a new location supplied by the user, or from a back-up copy to avoid future changes to the map preventing the code from running should there be a mistake in the new map. 
4. The GIS attributes are then separated from the polygons to allow for efficient data handling. In this step the data are cleaned, e.g. white space and inconsistent data separators were corrected. The "HAB_TYPE" column in the GIS habitat map is the main source of information which describes the EUNIS habitats associated with each polygon on the habitat map. Where more than one habitat were associated with a polygon, only the first instance was kept, as this is understood to be the dominant habitat in that polygon. 
5. Step five associates the EUNIS levels to the data set, based on the number of characters in the EUNIS code provided. This step allows for splitting the assessed data according to levels further down the process. 
6. Step six is the critical step in the code. In step 6, the GIS data set is also attributed with habitat levels. This dataset is then split to according the sub-biogeoregions (sbgr), and only a unique set of EUNIS codes per sbgr is retained in parameter called "bgr.dfs.lst". The database-sourced habitat sensitivity assessments are then split into matrices according to their EUNIS levels, called "x.dfs.lst". 
The two data sets (two lists containing matrices) are then matched in a cross tabulation exercise, such that where character coding of a fine-scale habitat matches that of a broad-scale habitat, the fine-scale habitat is recorded as a new value in the cross tabulation.  The matrices of unique habitats per sbgr ("bgr.dfs.lst") were therefore sequentially matched assessment data matrices ("bgr.dfs.lst"). The process is therefore done for separately for of the sub-biogeoregions, within a EUNIS level, and repeated until all sub-biogeoregions are complete, before it moves onto the next EUNIS level. The result is a set of data matrices in which per EUNIS level and where the fine-scale habitats which correspond to broad-scale habitat (EUNIS level 2 - 3) are stored as values in cross tabulated data matrices. 
7. In step seven, the data matrices of the same according to sub-biogeoregion, were then merged into a single data matrix ("sbgr.matched.btpt.w.rpl") for each sbgr, as follows: the data matrix representing EUNIS level 4 was overlaid on the the data matrix representing EUNIS level 5, replacing only values in this matrix where there was not already a value in the EUNIS level 5 data matrix.i.e. replace missing values. This new dataset was then overlaid onto the EUNIS level 6 data matrix,again replacing only missing values. The result was a single data matrix for each sbgr, in which the fine-scale habitat was retained per matching broad-scale habitat. Note that multiple fine-scale habitats may be associated with a broad-scale habitat within its sbgr. 
8. In step eight, the unique combinations of fine-scale habitats in broad-scale habitats is joined to the list of habitat sensitivities per pressure, for each per sbgr  within each activity ("act.press.list"). This generated a new list of data matrices data matrices ("xap.ls"). In this new list of data matrices all unique fine-scale-habitats-within-broad-scale habitats were associated with the habitat assessments, with one data matrix per  pressure-sensitivity combination. 
9. Step nine compares and keeps only maximum values for each biotope-pressure-activity-sub-biogeographic region combination. maximum is retained in a R list "act.sbgr.bps.gis". 
10. The outputs from step nine are used in step ten, where it retains only the habitat-sensitivity assessment of the assessed habitats which had the highest sensitivity score using a maximum filter, per GIS polygon ID value. This set of data matrices are stored in an R object "sbgr.BAP.max.sens". The confidence assessments were associated with the resulting maps using a join between the EUNIS habitat codes in the habitat map and that from the table where the EUNIS assessments are stored.
12. The sbgr.BAP.max.sens is then associated (joined) to the GIS habitat map layer, and saved as a new geopackage (gpkg) file outside of R, in the directory specified at the start by the user.

## Other sensitivity concepts 
Other common concepts in NE's Conservation Advice include the Vulnerability and Exposure. Vulnerability is the measure of the degree of exposure of a receptor to a pressure to which it is sensitive (Based on [@hiscockAssessingSeabedSpecies1999;  @oakwoodenvironmentalltdDevelopmentMethodologyAssessment2002]). Exposure is the action of a pressure on a receptor, with regard to the extent, magnitude and duration of the pressure [@robinsonMarineAssessmentMonitoring2010].
