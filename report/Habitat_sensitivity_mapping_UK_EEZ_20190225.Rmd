# Introduction

The United Kingdom's (UK) marine environment is of significant economic value, in which the exploitative activities and infrastructure development is constantly weighed up against their impact on the environment [@walportForesightFutureSea2017].  The UK's marine environment is subject to a vast array of pressures, such as fishing operations, marine aggregate dredging, development of renewable energy and risks of pollution from oil spills among many others. Overfishing and habitat loss are regarded as two of the main contributors to the degradation of the UK's marine environment [@walportForesightFutureSea2017]. Benthic habitats different in their degree of sensitivity to impacts from different kinds of pressures arising from the various fishing activities [@dupliseaSizebasedModelImpacts2002; @hiddinkAssessingPredictingRelative2007]. Delineating the geographical distribution of habitat sensitivity has been identified as critical dataset for managing human activities on the marine environment [@baxSeabedHabitatSoutheastern2001]. The sensitivity of marine habitats have previously been defined as sensitivity as: *"The intolerance of a species or habitat to damage from an external factor and the time taken for its subsequent recovery"*,[Laffoley et al. (2000); Tyler-Walters & Hiscock (2005)](https://www.marlin.ac.uk/sensitivity/sensitivity_rationale)), or, *"the degree to which marine features respond to stresses, which are deviations of environmental conditions beyond the expected range"* [@zachariasSensitivityVulnerabilityMarine2005]. In this project spatial models were developed which show the sensitivity of the benthic habitat to various fishing activities in England's marine environment.

Commercial fishing operations are widespread throughout the United Kingdom, and is fished by both national and international fleets within the remits of the London Fisheries Convention (1964) and the Common Fishery Policy (CFP 1970s). The withdrawal of the UK from the European Union (EU exit/Brexit), [European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, section 20](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/16/section/20); [Article 50](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:12016M/TXT&from=EN), is likely to lead to change in fisheries regulations [@phillipsonSeaTroublesBrexit2018]. Leaving the EU may change how fish stocks are shared across political borders, quota allocation to EU-member states in the UK, and Total Allowable Catch (TAC) for different stocks among many other aspects related to managing the UK fishing grounds [@phillipsonSeaTroublesBrexit2018]. A change in fishing regulations and management may therefore have substantial ramifications fishing operations in the UK. The spatial distribution of fishing effort among various fishing metiers is a key element is likely to be influenced by a change in regulations [@vaughanFishingEffortDisplacement2017]. Previous research has shown that a displacement of fishing effort could lead to detrimental environmental and socio-economic effects e.g. [@stevensonSocioeconomicConsequencesFishing2013]. It is therefore important that the impact on the marine environment brought about by a displacement of fishing effort be considered prior to adopting new regulations or change in management practices [@vaughanFishingEffortDisplacement2017; @chollettQuantifyingSqueezingStretching2016]. 

## Natural England's role in the marine environment
Natural England (NE) provides statutory conservation advice on operations in English Territorial Waters (from the shore to 12 NM offshore) to Defra (Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs), regulators and developers. Natural England's statutory remit in the marine environment is principally directed towards protected habitats and species within English Territorial Waters, known as designated features. In many cases this remit relates to Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) and the features designated for protection within them. Natural England also provides advice out to 200 NM offshore for renewable energy through the delegation of responsibility from the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC). JNCC provides conservation advice on fishing activities outside of territorial waters in English waters to Defra. This work provides indicative sensitivity outputs for 0-200nm in English waters. Natural England uses sensitivity assessments of designated features including benthic habitats and species to inform its Conservation Advice (Advice on Operations). The habitat sensitivity assessments are comprised of three principal components, namely 1) habitat, 2) activity, and 3) pressure.

### Habitat
This study was limited to the marine benthic habitat, comprised from the substratum and the community of organisms adhered to or living in close contact to the seabed. The definition of the multitude of benthic habitat categories used by NE is based on the pan-European adopted habitat classification system, known as the European Nature Information System (EUNIS). The EUNIS benthic habitat categories is a hierarchical system within which fine-scale habitat categories are nested within broader-scale habitat categories, referred to as EUNIS levels. At the top of the hierarchical classification system, the broadest definition of habitat corresponds, e.g. "Marine", to EUNIS level 1. At higher EUNIS values, the amount of thematic detail about the habitat increases progressively, for example, EUNIS level 2: A1 : Littoral rock and other hard substrata,
=======
Previous studies have developed tools to predict the impacts of fishing effort displacement, which forecast a change in fishing effort displacement [@bastardieDISPLACEDynamicIndividualbased2013]. This project did not attempt to predict a change in fishing activity given the significant uncertainty and complexity in how Brexit would affect fishing opportunities and regulations throughout English waters. Delineating the geographical distribution of habitat sensitivity has been identified as critical dataset for managing human activities on the marine environment [@baxSeabedHabitatSoutheastern2001]. The sensitivity of marine habitats have previously been defined as sensitivity as: *"The intolerance of a species or habitat to damage from an external factor and the time taken for its subsequent recovery"*,[Laffoley et al. (2000); Tyler-Walters & Hiscock (2005)](https://www.marlin.ac.uk/sensitivity/sensitivity_rationale)), or, *"the degree to which marine features respond to stresses, which are deviations of environmental conditions beyond the expected range"* [@zachariasSensitivityVulnerabilityMarine2005]. In this study habitat sensitivity to standardised pressures from various activities in the marine environment were mapped. Sensitivity mapping is a precautionary approach which could then be used to assess impacts from change in marine activities as they happen. This response, as opposed to predictive approach was preferred due to the multitude of uncertainties associated with fishing displacement, and other activities in the marine environment arising from EU exit. 

Natural England uses sensitivity assessments of protected benthic habitats and species to inform its Advice on Operations. The habitat sensitivity assessments are comprised of three principal components, namely 1) habitat, 2) pressure, and 3) activity (which may be attributed to an operation). 

## Habitat
This study was limited to the marine benthic habitats comprised from the substratum and the community of organisms adhered to or living in close contact to the seabed. The definition of the multitude of benthic habitat categories used by Natural England is based on the pan-European adopted habitat classification system, known as the European Nature Information System (EUNIS). The EUNIS benthic habitat classification is a hierarchical system within which fine-scale habitat categories are nested within broader-scale habitat categories, referred to as EUNIS levels. EUNIs level 1 is at the top of the hierarchical classification system where the broadest definition of habitat descerns marine habitat (A) from other habitats like terrestrial or freshwater. The amount of thematic detail about the habitat increases progressively With an increase in the EUNIS level as shown in the example below: 

EUNIS level 1: A: Marine,
EUNIS level 2: A1 : Littoral rock and other hard substrata,
EUNIS level 3: A1.1 : High energy littoral rock,
EUNIS level 4: A1.11 : Mussel and/or barnacle communities,
EUNIS level 5: A1.113 : *Semibalanus balanoides* on exposed to moderately exposed or vertical sheltered eulittoral rock,
EUNIS level 6: A1.1132 : *Semibalanus balanoides*, *Fucus vesiculosus* and red seaweeds on exposed to moderately exposed eulittoral rock. 

*See the* [EUNIS-webpage](https://eunis.eea.europa.eu/habitats-code-browser.jsp) *for more examples on the hierarchical view of the EUNIS habitat classification system.*

Designated habitat features are represented at an intermediate scale of detail, equivalent to EUNIS level 3. Natural England's conservation advice is therefore limited to a subset of the area of English Territorial Waters, and provided at a coarser scale of habitat detail than is available for a substantial area of the UK seabed. Natural England holds a bespoke dataset which details potential fine-scale habitats (EUNIS level 4 - 6) which occur within the broader habitat categories (EUNIS level 1 - 3) within the subbiogeographical sea regions in the inshore waters of England from 0 to 12 NM. The bespoke dataset was informed through expert consultation with Dr Keith Hiscock (Hiscock, K. 2016). There is currently work commissioned by JNCC which is identifying fine-scale habitats within broad-scale habits in the offshore (12 - 200 NM) using the same methodology. The latter data set will become incorporated into the overall data set in due course. 

### Activity
Standardized categories of human activities and natural events, to which pressures on the environment are associated. Activities can be grouped within operations. An example of an operation would be commercial fishing, whereas an activity would be demersal trawling.

### Pressure
Pressure is the force of stress exerted by an activity on marine benthic habitats. Every activity may be associated with numerous pressures which act simultaneously on these habitats. The nature of the pressure is determined by the activity type, intensity and distribution [@robinsonMarineAssessmentMonitoring2010]. An example of pressures exerted by demersal trawling would include (amongst others) penetration, abrasion and sedimentation. Pressures are standardised according to a  benchmark. A benchmark is a set level at which there are known effect and habitats or species. See the MarESA methods for more detail [@tyler-waltersMarineEvidencebasedSensitivity2018].

## Sensitivity assessments used by Natural England
Sensitivity assessments as used by NE are comprised of two components, namely 1) resistance and 2) resilience. The resistance is the ability of the substrate and the benthic community of organisms to withstand damage caused by a particular pressures associated with an activity. In other words, it is the likelihood of damage due to a pressure. The second component, resilience, is the time that it takes for the benthic community to regenerate and restore the productivity and/or biomass [@hiddinkAssessingPredictingRelative2007] to its former level prior to the impact. In the qualitative methods used by NE, resistance and resilience scores area are assigned to each habitat category based on literature reviews or expert judgement. Cross-tabulation of the categorical scores of resistance and resilience are then used to determine the sensitivity category in the MarESA methods [@tyler-waltersMarineEvidencebasedSensitivity2018]. A confidence score is then associated with each of the components of the sensitivity assessments, namely the resistance, resilience and overall sensitivity. The confidence score is based on the quality of the evidence and and its applicability to the assessment of the likely effects of a pressure on a given feature (species or habitat). The quality of the evidence is based on the reputability of the source, e.g. journal article, grey literature or expert opinion, and the level of agreement between the different sets of evidence [@tillinAssessingSensitivitySubtidal2014a; @davackAssessingSensitivitySeagrass2014].
<br>
Natural England's benthic habitat sensitivity assessments include 39 pressures associated with a 100 activities stemming from 18 operations in the marine environment. Other common concepts in NE's Conservation Advice include the Vulnerability and Exposure. Vulnerability is the measure of the degree of exposure of a receptor to a pressure to which it is sensitive (Based on [@hiscockAssessingSeabedSpecies1999;  @oakwoodenvironmentalltdDevelopmentMethodologyAssessment2002]). Exposure is the action of a pressure on a receptor, with regard to the extent, magnitude and duration of the pressure [@robinsonMarineAssessmentMonitoring2010].

## Previous sensitvity mapping work
Previous studies have developed tools to predict the impacts of fishing effort displacement, which forecast a change in the spatial distribution of fishing effort and the effort allocation between different fishing metiers [@bastardieDISPLACEDynamicIndividualbased2013]. This project did not attempt to predict fishing effort displacement given the significant uncertainty and complexity in how Brexit would affect fishing opportunities and regulations throughout English waters. Instead, models of benthic habitat sensitivity to pressures arising from fishing activities allow a responsive assessment of the by overlaying fishing activity data onto habitat sensitivity models. The sensitivity mapping is a precautionary approach which could then be used to assess impacts from change in marine activities as they happen. This response, as opposed to predictive approach was preferred due to the multitude of uncertainties associated with fishing displacement, and other activities in the marine environment arising from EU exit.
<br>
Previous attempts to use quantitative methods to delineate benthic habitat sensitivity were limited by the level of detail about the underlying benthic habitat upon which fishing activities impact. These studies have assumed that benthic habitat were comprised of four broad-scale categories, such as mud, muddy sand, sand and gravel. Current quantitative models therefore do not consider differences in living structures occurring within these habitats. These models are therefore likely to over- or under-estimate the sensitivity of fine-scale habitats within these very broad definitions of habitat. Alternative methods using score based or expert judged systems  to map out geographical distribution of habitat sensitivity e.g. [@tillinAssessingSensitivitySubtidal2014; @zachariasSensitivityVulnerabilityMarine2005] have been criticized for not being quantitative, and therefore not repeatable [@dupliseaSizebasedModelImpacts2002; @hiddinkAssessingPredictingRelative2007]. Despite this limitation, both quantitative and scored based systems of habitat sensitivity have commonly been based upon the same central tenet of resilience to pressures, and standardization of the pressures [@robertsReviewExistingApproaches2010].

## Wider seas and whole-site approach
In recognition that impacts from a displacement of fishing effort occurring outside of MPAs can have an impact on features within MPAs, a "wider-seas" and "whole-sites" approach was used in this project to assess the sensitivity of benthic habitats to fishing activities in English waters. The whole-sites and wider-seas approach means that currently protected features were not considered in isolation, but that the connectivity between benthic habitats were considered to provide a holistic overview the spatial distributions of fishing related impacts on the benthic habitat. 

## Project aims
The overarching aim of this project was to map the spatial distribution of sensitivity of fine-scale benthic habitats (EUNIS level 4 - 6) in relation to 39 pressures caused by fishing activities within English waters. The study area includes the wider seas (outside of MPAs) to provide evidence of sensitive habitats which may be affected by a displacement of fishing pressures arising from different scenarios of EU Exit. 

## Case study
In this report a case study was developed to inspect the application of the habitat sensitivity mapping in relation to spatial maps of fishing activity. The aims of the case study was to identify a) sensitive and not-fished, and b) not-sensitive and not-fished areas, as a potential source to inform management of options which identifies the spatial distribution of fishing effort which would minimise the impact on the benthic habitat.
<br>
Fishing activities have had profound effects on the UK's marine ecosystem, of which bottom towed fishing gears is one of the most damaging activities which altered benthic habitats, composition and trophic structure of fish and invertebrate communities over the last century of industrial fishing [@kaiserChangesMegafaunalBenthic1998; @jenningsImpactsTrawlingDisturbance2001; @hiddinkCumulativeImpactsSeabed2006; @tillinChronicBottomTrawling2006; @thurstanEffects118Years2010]. Bottom towed fishing gears impact the habitat through penetration of the seabed, abrasion as the gear is being towed, and sedimentation caused in the wake of the towed gear [@oneillPhysicalImpactTowed2016]. For these reasons, the sensitivity of benthic habitat to bottom towed gears were used in the case study. The objective of the case study was to quantify the proportion of low, medium and highly sensitive habitat currently under three pressures, including, i) penetration, ii) abrasion and iii) sedimentation, from three bottom towed fishing gears, namely, a) dredging, b) demersal otter trawling, and c) beam trawl activities in English waters.

# Methods

## Study Area
Marine habitat sensitivity maps were generated for English waters from the shoreline to the edge of the continental shelf, aproximately 200 NM offshore. The sensitivity maps were generated in two independent steps for two geographically adjacent areas: First for English Territorial Waters (0 - 12 NM, area in light blue in Figure 1), and second, the 12 - 200 NM offshore.

knitr::include_graphics(english_waters_img_path, dpi  = 150)
```
*to redo map - limit to English waters (0 - 200NM)*
<br>

The English inshore and offshore areas were treated independently as NE holds fine-scale data on the composition of the benthic habitats in 0 - 12 NM in England which was not available for the offshore (12 - 200 NM) English waters and 0 - 200 NM for Devolved Administrations at the time of writing. The fine-scale information on habitat composition was utilised in an additional step within the R modelling routines, which allowed biotope prediction within mapped broader scale habitats. The biotope level habitat information was obtained from additional data and expert validation which describes the likely biotopes within sub-biogeoregions within English waters.

## Data sources
Two main data sets were used to map the sensitivities for the marine benthic habitats within English waters, including 1) habitat sensitivity assessments, and 2) a marine habitat map for the English waters. The two data sources share a common field namely, the EUNIS habitat code, in the datasets and could therefore be joined to associate the sensitivity of habitat categories to the mapped habitat categories.

### Sensitivity assessments
Sensitivity assessments of each benthic habitat categories have been carried out for most EUNIS habitats using the MarESA methods [@tillinAssessingSensitivitySubtidal2014] as part of NE's ongoing Advice on Operations programme. The sensitivity of the EUNIS habitats levels 4 to 6 were assessed against 39 standardised pressures for each activity. The ten fishing activities in the Advice on Operations database were included in this project (see Table 1). The pressures are standardised according to benchmarks, for which the benchmark value is defined at which point an effect caused by the pressure is expected [@tillinAssessingSensitivitySubtidal2014]. The 39 pressures include the 36 OSPAR standardised pressures and an additional three which allow specifying direction of a pressure rather than one parameter stating non-directional change (Table 2). For example, instead of one pressure stating a change of 0.5&deg; C, two separate pressures are included stating an increase of 0.5&deg; C and another a decrease of 0.5&deg; C. For details about the benchmarks please see Tillin et al  [-@tillinAssessingSensitivitySubtidal2014]. One of six levels of sensitivity were assigned to each habitat category in response to each of the 39 pressures, each with their own defined benchmark (Table 3). The sensitivity score was based on the resistance and resilience of the habitat. See [@tillinAssessingSensitivitySubtidal2014] for details.

#### Sensitivity assessments database
The sensitivity assessment data is also stored internally at NE in a Microsoft Access database, namely, PD_AoO.accdb. The Microsoft Access database, PD_AoO.accdb, was used as the source for the sensitivity assessments of the EUNIS habitats in relation to the activities and pressures in this project. The sensitivity assessments are used to inform NE's Advice on Operations (AoO), available as conservation advice packages to the public on the [Designated Sites View](https://designatedsites.naturalengland.org.uk/Marine/MarineSiteDetail.aspx?SiteCode=UKMCZ0045&SiteName=aln&countyCode=&responsiblePerson=&SeaArea=&IFCAArea=).

Sensitivity confidence assessments provide an indication of the level of confidence associated with each sensitivity assessment using the MarESA methods. The confidence assessments provides three types of confidence assessments, Quality of Evidence (QoE), Applicability of Evidence (AoE) and Degree of concordance between Evidence (DoE). Each of these confidence assessments were carried out for each of the sensitivity components, namely, Resistance, Resilience and Sensitivity. The QoE provides a measure regard for the origin of the evidence, e.g. peer review journal article, grey literature, expert opinion. The AoE provides a measure of how realistic is it for a given pressure to impact upon a habitat. The DoE provides a measure of the agreement between different evidence sources. The higher the confidence score, the greater the level of confidence in the assessment.

Only the quality of evidence (QoE) for overall sensitivity was displayed as a map in this study, but all measures are available for mapping. No attempt was made to amalgamate confidence indices into single measures, as what they represent becomes lost when doing so, especially if this were to be combined with the spatial confidence of the habitat map.

#### Marine habitat map
The benthic habitat map used by NE (Marine_Evidence_Base_Internal.gdb, layer = BSH), was used as the basis to inform the spatial distribution of benthic habitats within English waters for this project. The habitat categories contained within NE's habitat map are based on the EUNIS classification developed in conjunction with the JNCC [@daviesEUNISHabitatClassification2004; @galparsoroUsingEUNISHabitat2012]. The habitat map is continuously updated as new information on habitat becomes available following a well defined process between NE and JNCC. The extent of the habitat map was: -24.2816553949999729,47.9878704700000753 : 3.7191888160000417,64.0702531440000485, in datum World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84). The habitat map included over a million (1,207,497) polygons, each which have previously been attributed with a habitat type category following the [EUNIS habitat classification](https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/eunis-habitat-classification). The map below shows the variety of habitats, and the differences in the levels of EUNIS habitats. The map also shows that more than one type of habitat may be associated with a given polygon. In this study, only the habitat category (EUNIS code) appearing first in the attribute table where a list of possible habitats were entered in field "HAB_TYPE" was used in this study. Attempting to create sensitivity maps for all possible habitat types listed in the "HAB_TYPE" column in the attribute table was beyond the scope of this project and would result in significant delays. The habitat type (EUNIS Code) listed first under "HAB_TYPE" in the attribute table was used as it was the most likely habitat or the most abundant within the polygon (Timothy Fegan, Lead Advisor, Marine GI, Evidence Services NE, personal comment). For example, if a polygon had EUNIS code A1.1/A1.2, only A1.1 would have been used. See the habitat map below for UK, and the legend which shows a sample from the "HAB_TYPE" column (Figure 2).

<br>

The EUNIS benthic habitat categories which appear on the habitat map were associated with habitat categories contained within the sensitivity assessment database. By joining these datasets sensitivity maps for benthic habitat to the various pressures and activities were generated. The following steps were taken to produce the habitat sensitivity maps from the aforementioned data sources.

<br>

The habitat map was comprised habitat categories which were of different EUNIS levels (2 - 6). The differences in the habitat categories (EUNIS levels) is a result of different amounts of data available for the different areas in English waters. The habitat map abnd habitat classification system is updated by NE and JNCC as new information becomes available. As such, there is variability in the amount of detail about the habitat (substrate and benthos), as well as variability in confidence between the mapped areas (referred to as polygons hereafter). The habitat map is therefore comprised of a patchwork of polygons which may differ in their shape, area and the habitat category (and EUNIS level) which they represent, as well as the level of confidence with which the habitat was category was assigned to it. The confidence associated with habitat classification of each polygon is represented by a MESH (Mapping European Seabed Habitats) score (*Annex MESH confidence*). MESH scores are derived from the confidence associated with different data sources used to inform the classification of the habitat category assigned to a polygon. The data sources used to generate the benthic habitat map are based on a variety of methods and data sources, such as remote sensing, side-scan sonar, sediment grabs and SCUBA-diver surveys. While The MESH confidence assessment applies directly to the sensitivity map, it is not explored further in this report, as it is the standard existing confidence assessment of habitat category assignment associated with the habitat map. The MESH score is included as a column in the outputs but not presented here.

### Addressing the mismatch in EUNIS habitat assessments and the habitat map.
A significant proportion (70 %) of the mapped area of inshore and offshore habitats corresponded to EUNIS habitat categories which have been assessed for sensitivity, but about 30% of the area included habitat categories which have not had not been assessed. The main reason for this was the mismatch in the habitat categories included in the habitat map and those that have been assessed for sensitivity to pressures. The habitat map includes EUNIS level 2 - 6, while the assessments only cover EUNIS level 4 - 6. 

```{r eunis_mismatch, fig.cap= "Figure 3: The overlap and mismatch between the EUNIS levels which have had sensitivity assessments and those on the habitat map.",  echo = FALSE}
eunis_mismatch_img_path <- "F:/projects/marine_biotope_sensitivity/report/figures/EUNIS_mismatch_20190319.png"

knitr::include_graphics(eunis_mismatch_img_path, dpi = 150)
```
In order to remedy the mismatch of EUNIS levels between the map and the database, an approach was adopted in which the sensitivities of fine-scale habitats were assigned to the mapped polygons which did not have sensitivity assessments. This assignment of fine-scale habitats to broad-scale habitats within the inshore (0 - 12 NM) were done as follows:

### Integrating fine-scale benthic habitats within inshore sub-biogeoregions 
Fine-scale benthic habitats (EUNIS level 4 - 6) which are known to occur within sub-biogeoregions (Figure 4) within (0 - 12 NM) were identified by Dr Keith Hiscock in project for NE [@hiscockAssigningEUNISClassification2016]. The fine-scale habitats were then associated with the broad-scale habitats within each sub-biogeoregion, where the fine-scale habitat were 1) known to occur in the given sub-biogeoregion, and 2) a the assessed habitat is a "child" fine-scale habitat of a "parent" broad-scale habitat. i.e. the fine-scale habitat had to be related to the broad-scale habitat, such as a habitat with EUNIS code A5.12 is a parent of A5.127. Each broad-scale (parent) habitat could therefore have multiple fine-scale (child) habitats associated to it within the given sub-biogeoregion. The child habitat of the highest EUNIS level and the highest sensitivity was assigned to parent habitats to inform sensitivity assessments. Sensitivity assessments of higher EUNIS levels were therefore preferred over sensitivity assessments at lower levels, where available. This habitat category replacement was justified under the assumption that fine-scale habitats would provide a more realistic assessment of the true sensitivity to a pressure, than the lower EUNIUS level (parent). This was based on the idea that an understanding of the sensitivity of benthic communities and the substrate would be more informative than sensitivity of the substrate alone. This information was not currently available for the offshore, but JNCC is working on such a project [@tillinAssiningEUNISClassification2017], and when the data becomes available, it will be incorporated in to the offshore model, as for the inshore.
<br>
```{r sub-biogeoregions, fig.cap= "Figure 4: The inshore sub-biogeoregions within which fine-scale habitats (EUNIS level 4 - 6) are known, and were assocaited with broad-scale habitats from which fine scale habitat on the habitat map.",  echo = FALSE, , out.extra='style="background-color: #FFFFFF; padding:20px; display: inline-block;"'}

### Data processing
GIS steps were required to split the original English waters habitat map into an inshore (0 - 12 NM) and offshore component (12 - 200 NM). All other technical data manipulation was carried out using the R statistical environment in effort to make the work repeatable and provide instant results following updates to the sensitivity assessment database (PD_AoO.accdb) or updates to the benthic habitat map.

### GIS steps 
Geoprocessing tools in QGIS was used for the production of the inshore (0 - 12 NM) and offshore (12 - 200 NM) areas.
The habitat map (master copy - Marine_Evidence_Base_Internal.gdb) was copied, and (step 1) clipped (using the DIFFERENCE geoprocessing tool in QGIS) keeping the area inside the English 12 NM boundary to create the basis for the inshore habitat map. The sub-bioregional shapefile was used to (step 2) associate the sub-biogeoregions (subbiogeoregions_clipped12nm_joined_sbgr_PH_wgs84.shp) to the individual polygons comprising the inshore habitat map, using INTERSECT geoprocessing tool in QGIS.Outputs were stored as geopackage files to explore the use of open source standard file formats (and tools) in order to promote their use within the organisation.
<br>
The files used to generate the inshore (inside 12NM) habitat map are specified below:
Step 1 & 2:
<br>
```{r GI_filenames, echo=FALSE}
print("Marine_Evidence_Base_Internal.gdb  DIFFERENCE with mask_minus_12nm_and_land_WGS84.shp
--> Input_Polys_WGS84_Internal_BGR_inside_12nm.gpkg")
 #------------

print("Input_Polys_WGS84_Internal_BGR_inside_12nm.gpkg INTERSECT with subbiogeoregions_clipped12nm_joined_sbgr_PH_wgs84.shp
--> sbgr_input_poly_wgs84_internal_bgr_inside_12nm.gpkg")
```
<br>

The GIS process for the inshore map can be depicted in flow diagram as follows, where the files shown above were the input to the GI geoprocessing tools shown below.

<br>

```{r GI_process, fig.cap="Figure 5. The GIS processes followed to prepare the data set prior to implementing the R scripts.", echo =FALSE}

GIS_process_path <- "F:/projects/marine_biotope_sensitivity/report/figures/gis_process_map.png"
knitr::include_graphics(GIS_process_path, dpi = 150)

```
<br>
The offshore habitat map was prepared by clipping (DIFFERENCE geoprocessing tool in QGIS) with the English 12 NM boundary, keeping the area outside of the 12 NM boundary. A column was added to the offshore dataset (built into the R script described below), equivalent to the subbiogeoregion column added to the inshore habitat map, but here labeling all polygons as "offshore", to allow merging of the end products. The files used for the offshore data layer are specified below.
<br>

```{r GI_offshore_files, echo=FALSE, , out.extra='style="background-color: #FFFFFF; padding:20px; display: inline-block;"'}
print("Offshore (outside 12 NM) habitat map
F:/copy_data/Marine_Evidence_Base_Internal.gdb → CLIP with D:/projects/fishing_displacement/2_subprojects_and_data/2_GIS_DATA/masks/mask_minus_12nm_and_land.shp")
```

<br>

### R-code steps
All programming to generate habitat sensitivity layers was carried out in R. the files are stored on NE's GitHub [webpage](https://github.com/naturalengland/marine_biotope_sensitivity). Here only the high-level overview of how the code works is described. Details about what each section of code does is broadly described in the Annex, and specific details are described within each R-file. The inshore and offshore are two separate sets of code, and run independently, after they were split using the GIS described above. The R scripts developed for processing the inshore and offshore data follow the same steps as described below. In essence the R-code read the sensitivity assessments (and associated confidence scores) and GIS data into the R statistical environment (an instance of the R programme), where it associated the sensitivity assessments to the respective benthic habitat maps (inshore and offshore). In the offshore the R-code evaluates the fine-scale habitats which may occur within broad-scale habitats, and associates the individual mapped habitat polygons to the fine-scale habitat assessments with the highest sensitivity score. For the offshore, it uses the habitat code provided as is, and does not attempt to find fine-scale habitats within broad-scale habitats, for the reasons provided earlier. The data are then saved and exported to geopackage for the inshore and offshore components, respectively. 

## Case Study
### Fishing activity data investigation
The spatial match of scallop dredging activity was compared to the distribution of sensitive habitats. The habitat sensitivity map to abrasion (pressure code D6) from dredging (activity code Z5) in the inshore area was used. Offshore sensitivity may be added in due course once JNCC data is incorporated in the analysis. The aggregated dredging activity between 2013-2014 stored in file "Fishermap_JNCC_NE/MMO_UK_VMS_Fishing_Activity.gdb" was used as a realistic and recent example of the geographic distribution of dredging pressure in the English waters. The above dredging activity data set contains scallop dredging, tractor drawn dredging, and rake dredging data, but the latter two only apply to the shoreline-area. Areas known for other kinds of dredging activity, such as hydraulic dredging at The Wash were excluded after the identification of areas with relatively high fishing pressure in the Results. Areas with relatively high level of dredging activity were identified by setting a minimum threshold of including cells from the activity map where dredging activity exceeded 20 % of the highest activity value. This was done to restrict the area of investigation to distinct (and disjointed) areas where fishing pressure was greatest. If no cut-off value was applied, the areas become very large and connected along he inshore 12NM boundary.

*Select values above 10.82, and attribute them with "aoi" field. Then dissoolve based on that field, and intersect/clip habitat sensitivity to establish the area with high fishing sensitivity*
*Can be exported and anlaysed further (but may wish to intersct with the grid again to obtain finer grained values).*

#### Identifying scalloping areas with high levels of dredging activity.
A substantial inshore area was associated with relatively high levels of dredging activity.  The offshore areas between Worthing and Eastbourne was the largest contiguous area with relatively high levels (>10.8) of dredging activity. Dredging around this area was assumed to be largely focused on scallop dredging, as a large number of scallop dredgers operate from Shoreham Harbour, near Worthing. The Shoreham scallop dredgers effort was predominantly focused in the offshore area (Figure 6). Other areas with relatively high levels of dredging activity thought to be scallop dredging include Portsmouth, Brixham which had highest activity levels inshore. A large area between Falmouth and Plymouth had relatively high levels of dredging activity associated within the inshore area. There was an area with relatively high levels of dredging activity straddled across the inshore and the offshore between Newlyn and the Isles of Scilly. The offshore area between Isle of Man and Blackpool in the Irish Sea was another area with relatively high levels of scallop dredging. These core areas of interest were validated using MMO landings data [website](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/marine-management-organisation). 

```{r seafish, echo = FALSE}

```

*Note: In future this layer may be replaced by another, but here it is meant to be proof of concept for internal use. Future reports should include more information on background of Fishermap_JNCC_NE\MMO_UK_VMS_Fishing_Activity.gdb data to spell out details around the layer; and describe the values on the table.* 

<br>
*Idea for later?*
The Marine Conservation Zones (MCZs) were overlaid onto the fishing activity map to to provide perspective of the location of activities and existing protected areas. Other forms of protected areas, SACs, SPAs may be added in future if the project further investigates the three-way relationship of sensitive habitats, activities at sea and the location of protected areas.

# Results

## Sensitivity mapping
In total about 154 valid combinations of benthic habitat sensitivity assessments against 39 pressures from each the ten fishing activities, for the inshore and for the offshore respectively. I.e. including both inshore and offshore 308 habitat sensitivity maps. Not all activities-pressure-habitat combinations have valid interactions, and therefore the total is not 390 per inshore/offshore data set. These mapable data columns were accompanied by the same number of confidence assessments and assessed fine-scale habitat type (child of broader habitat type). In total 462 new columns were added to the habitat map, each representing either a sensitivity to a activity pressure combination, the associated fine-scale habitat, and the confidence of the sensitivity assessment. The mapable data columns were stored in two files, one for the offshore, and another for the inshore as geopackages. The geopackages were vector based, and mirror the spatial resolution and habitat detail of the benthic habitat map, as the mapable columns become attached to the existing habitat map.

The R script which generates the mapable data set has the capability to instantly produce similar data sets for 18 operations (for the inshore and offshore). The R scripts were not run for all operations, as the outputs would require a significant amount of data storage space (approximately 160 GB). The fact that these maps can and should be updated as new data becomes incorporated into the database and habitat map was sufficient reason to produce the maps only as and when needed the outputs for other activities and operations are required. 
In the offshore 154 sensitivity maps were produced, for the 10 fishing activities included in NE's conservation advice.

## Case study results

The spatial distribution of benthic habitat sensitivity to abrasion from dredging is shown in Figure 6. The offshore is characterized by large contiguous (connected) areas of medium or low level sensitivity. The inshore benthic habitat is characterized by a patchwork of habitat sensitivities including high to low sensitive habitats. For example, the offshore area in the English Channel is dominated by low sensitivity habitat, while the inshore area in the English Channel has several areas of medium to high sensitivity, such as Skerries Bank, and reef areas off Plymouth.

### Overview of inshore and offshore habitat sensitivity
Sub-biogeoregion 2c in the Southern North Sea and sub-biogeoregion 5 in the Irish Sea had the greatest proportional area of highly sensitive habitats, each covering about 1.6 % of the total inshore area. Large areas in sub-biogeoregions 1a and 1b in the northern North Sea had medium sensitivity, and each covered over 30 % of the total inshore area.
<br>
The majority of the total area of the offshore marine environment (53.2 %) was dominated by medium level sensitivity to abrasion from dredging. Almost 28.8 % percent of the total offshore area was not assessed, and the remaining area was comprised of 16.6 % low sensitivity and 1.2 % high sensitivity.

### Example of information extractable at a fine-scale:

#### Inshore polygons with high sensitivity
The largest inshore habitat polygon which had a high level of sensitivity and covered an area almost 1.6 % of the English Territorial Waters. This polygon had a habitat classification of sublittoral mixed sediments (A5.4), which was assessed as fine-scale habitat category *Cerianthus lloydii* and other burrowing anemones in circalittoral muddy mixed sediment (A5.441) against dredging pressure  (Z10_5)from abrasion pressure (D6). This fine-scale habitat type had a high level of sensitivity with low degree of confidence in the assessment (Quality of Evidence). The parent habitat type (A5.4) had a medium to high degree of confidence associated with a MESH score  of 66 out of 100. Future analysis will look at contiguous areas (connected polygons) using habitat patch statistics.

#### Inshore polygons which were not sensitive
The largest non-sensitive area to abrasion from dredging was a polygon off Margate Longsands with habitat type A5.137, Dense *Lanice conchilega* and other polychaetes in tide-swept infralittoral sand and mixed gravelly sand. The assessment had a high level of confidence based on the Quality of the Evidence and a high degree of confidence in the mapped habitat type (MESH score 81). See the sensitivity assessment on the [MarLIN webpage]( https://www.marlin.ac.uk/habitats/detail/116) for more detailed information on the reasons for the non-sensitive habitat type outcome.

## Fine-scale habitats within broad-scale habitats

The outputs from the model provides the fine-scale (child) habitat (EUNIS level 4 - 6) which was used in the sensitivity assessment in the place of the broad-scale (parent) habitat (EUNIS level 2 - 3). The habitat codes which were assessed were therefore all EUNIS level 4 or above, as illustrated by Figure 9 showing a sample of habitat codes. Only the inshore habitat replacement is shown at this stage and the offshore will be added following JNCC commisioned project in which fine-scale habitats known to occur within broad-scale habitats are being assigned within each sub-biogeoregion [@tillinAssiningEUNISClassification2017]

## Confidence measure - Quality of Evidence
The confidence of the sensitivity assessments for the inshore and offshore based on the quality of the evidence (QOE) is shown in Figure 10. The confidence map showed that generally the quality of evidence was higher for habitats assessed in the inshore than offshore areas, but the offshore is subject to change following an update to the habitats used during assessments. The English channel generally had relatively high levels of confidence associated with sensitivity assessments.

## Case study: Scallop dredging activity in sensitive benthic habitat

Eight areas of interest were initially identified from the spatial distribution of dredging effort. From these eight areas, five areas were considered to largely represent high levels of scallop dredging, namely, 1) Worthing to easterbourne, 2) Brixham, 3) Falmouth to Plymouth, 4) Newlyen to the Isels of Scilly, and 5) Isle of Man to Blackpool. The Wash was characterized by having the highest levels of dredging activity in England, however this was thought to be largely based on hydraulic dredging and was therefore not considered further. The Solent area which also had high levels of dredging activity was removed from the study as it was thought not to be focused around scallop dredging. Cardigan Bay had high levels of dredging, but was not further considered as it is outside of English waters.

### Area per habitat sensitivity in areas with high levels of fishing pressure. 

*Inshore statistics*
And provide some analysis of the proportion of sensitivity categories which overlap with dredging activity (which may need to be categorised into high/medium/low?) 
<br>
A 100 by 100m grid of randomly stratified points were overlaid over the inshore benthic habiat sensitivity map to sample the proportion of sensitivity habitat this. 

*Inshore*
The majority (58 %) of inshore area under high levels of scallop dredging  activity  (more than 10 passess between 2009 and 2014) was of low sensitivity. A third of the area consisted of habitats with medium levels of sensitivity, and about 9 % consisted of highly sensitve habitats which were under high levels of scallop dredging activity. 
<br>
Eight categories of highly sensitive habitats are currently impacted by scallop dredging, including A3.311,A4.111, A4.131, A4.231, A5.321, A5.421, A5.421, A5.441, A5.511. *add table with EUNIS habitat descriptions*

The largest concentration of effort on highly sensitive habitat is in the area between Falmouth to Plymouth. This sensitivty was informed by fine-scale benthic habitat A5.421 attributed to a large polygon on the habitat map offically classified as habitat type A5.4.

*Offshore*
In the offshore 96 % of sampling points in high levels of dredging overlapped with low sensitivity habitat, and the remaining 4 % overlapped with habitat with levels of sensitivity.
Medium sensitivie offshore habitat included A4.231 and A5.271.



# Discussion

The sensitivity maps 

## Future development of the research
In a second phase essential fish habitat which are currently only lightly impacted, or not impacted will be identified.

A follow up project will consider: 
A third project objective is the development of maps of the sensitivity distribution for 30 fish and shellfish species within UK waters to fishing related activities. These models are underpinned by sensitivity assessments carried out at set benchmarks, and coupled with species distribution models.

## Compare with quantitaive methods
This is fundamentally different from how recovery time is estimated using quantitative methods. Recovery as used in quantitative models follows a mathematical formula such as a modified Lotka–Volterra to estimate the based on the assumption that the recovery rate of organisms is uniform according to size and being soft or hard bodied organisms [dupliseaSizebasedModelImpacts2002].

The R-code steps to process the habitat assessment and GI data are outlined below.	

## R-code steps
The code is structured as a main script which calls sixteen helper functions to run the separate processes sequentially over 11 steps.
In the main script, the user provides input, such as the locality of the input data sources, e.g. Microsoft Access database, and habitat maps. Furthermore, the location of outputs generated, and the choice of file names. Once the user enters these inputs, the main body of the code can be run, where upon the user will be prompted to select one of the 18 Operations for which to generate habitat sensitivity maps. Once the user has entered their selection, the code runs without further user input requirements.

#### The eleven steps follow:
The main script now starts calling the helper functions, one  at a time, and passes on output from a previous step for further processing. It starts by 
1. Reading the desired section of data from the MS Access database, which it runs through a query to obtain a list of EUNIS habitat types and their sensitivity assessments. 
2. It then ranks the possible combinations of sensitivity scores from 1 - 6 based on the degree of their sensitivity, to allow selecting the greatest (maximum) sensitivity associated with a fine-scale habitat occurring within a broad-scale habitat, further down the process (see step 10). The ranks are then associated to the appropriate sensitivity category in the list of EUNIS-sensitivity assessments. A lists of unique combinations of sensitivities to each pressure (39) is then generated for each of the assessed EUNIS habitats, separately for each activity within the operation. ("act.press.list").
3. The GIS file (geodatabase) is read in either from a new location supplied by the user, or from a back-up copy to avoid future changes to the map preventing the code from running should there be a mistake in the new map. 
4. The GIS attributes are then separated from the polygons to allow for efficient data handling. In this step the data are cleaned, e.g. white space and inconsistent data separators were corrected. The "HAB_TYPE" column in the GIS habitat map is the main source of information which describes the EUNIS habitats associated with each polygon on the habitat map. Where more than one habitat were associated with a polygon, only the first instance was kept, as this is understood to be the dominant habitat in that polygon. 
5. Step five associates the EUNIS levels to the data set, based on the number of characters in the EUNIS code provided. This step allows for splitting the assessed data according to levels further down the process. 
6. Step six is the critical step in the code. In step 6, the GIS data set is also attributed with habitat levels. This dataset is then split to according the sub-biogeoregions (sbgr), and only a unique set of EUNIS codes per sbgr is retained in parameter called "bgr.dfs.lst". The database-sourced habitat sensitivity assessments are then split into matrices according to their EUNIS levels, called "x.dfs.lst". 
The two data sets (two lists containing matrices) are then matched in a cross tabulation exercise, such that where character coding of a fine-scale habitat matches that of a broad-scale habitat, the fine-scale habitat is recorded as a new value in the cross tabulation.  The matrices of unique habitats per sbgr ("bgr.dfs.lst") were therefore sequentially matched assessment data matrices ("bgr.dfs.lst"). The process is therefore done for separately for of the sub-biogeoregions, within a EUNIS level, and repeated until all sub-biogeoregions are complete, before it moves onto the next EUNIS level. The result is a set of data matrices in which per EUNIS level and where the fine-scale habitats which correspond to broad-scale habitat (EUNIS level 2 - 3) are stored as values in cross tabulated data matrices. 
7. In step seven, the data matrices of the same according to subbiogeoregion, were then merged into a single data matrix ("sbgr.matched.btpt.w.rpl") for each sbgr, as follows: the data matrix representing EUNIS level 4 was overlaid on the the data matrix representing EUNIS level 5, replacing only values in this matrix where there was not already a value in the EUNIS level 5 data matrix.i.e. replace missing values. This new dataset was then overlaid onto the EUNIS level 6 data matrix,again replacing only missing values. The result was a single data matrix for each sbgr, in which the fine-scale habitat was retained per matching broad-scale habitat. Note that multiple fine-scale habitats may be associated with a broad-scale habitat within its sbgr. 
8. In step eight, the unique combinations of fine-scale habitats in broad-scale habitats is joined to the list of habitat sensitivities per pressure, for each per sbgr  within each activity ("act.press.list"). This generated a new list of data matrices data matrices ("xap.ls"). In this new list of data matrices all unique fine-scale-habitats-within-broad-scale habitats were associated with the habitat assessments, with one data matrix per  pressure-sensitivity combination. 
9. Step nine compares and keeps only maximum values for each biotope-pressure-activity-sub-biogeographic region combination. maximum is retained in a R list "act.sbgr.bps.gis". 
10. The outputs from step nine are used in step ten, where it retains only the habitat-sensitivity assessment of the assessed habitats which had the highest sensitivity score using a maximum filter, per GIS polygon ID value. This set of data matrices are stored in an R object "sbgr.BAP.max.sens". The confidence assessments were associated with the resulting maps using a join between the EUNIS habitat codes in the habitat map and that from the table where the EUNIS assessments are stored.
12. The sbgr.BAP.max.sens is then associated (joined) to the GIS habitat map layer, and saved as a new geopackage (gpkg) file outside of R, in the directory specified at the start by the user.
